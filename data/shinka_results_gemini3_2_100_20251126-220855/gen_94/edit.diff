     Randomized S3-FIFO Eviction Policy:
     - Structure: Small (10%) + Main (90%) + Ghost (200%).
     - Key Innovation: Probabilistic Survival.
       - Standard S3-FIFO fails on loops > cache size because items flush out before reuse.
       - We introduce a 1% chance for items to survive eviction (both from Small and Main).
       - This breaks synchronization in loops, allowing a subset of items to stay, get hit,
         increase frequency, and establish a protected working set.
