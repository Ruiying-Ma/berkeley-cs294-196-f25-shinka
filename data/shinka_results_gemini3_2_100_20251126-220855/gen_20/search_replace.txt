<DESCRIPTION>
I propose replacing the Segmented LRU (SLRU) algorithm with S3-FIFO (Simple, Scalable, Static FIFO). S3-FIFO is a state-of-the-art eviction algorithm that often outperforms LRU and SLRU by using three queues: a Small FIFO queue (S) for new insertions (filtering out one-hit wonders), a Main FIFO queue (M) for popular items, and a Ghost queue (G) to track history of evicted items from S.

The logic:
1.  **Insertion**: New items enter `S`. If the item is in `G` (meaning it was evicted from `S` recently), it is promoted to `M`.
2.  **Eviction**:
    -   If `S` is larger than 10% of capacity, we inspect the tail of `S`. If accessed recently, it's moved to `M`. Otherwise, it's evicted and added to `G`.
    -   Otherwise, we inspect the tail of `M`. If accessed recently, it's reinserted to `M` (giving it a second chance). Otherwise, it's evicted.
3.  **Hits**: Only update a frequency counter (capped at 3). Movement happens lazily during eviction.

This approach is scan-resistant (scans flush through `S` without affecting `M`) and handles looping patterns better via the Ghost queue.
