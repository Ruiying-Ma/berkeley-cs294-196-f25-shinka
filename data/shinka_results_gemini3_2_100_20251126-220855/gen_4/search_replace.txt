<DESCRIPTION>
Implement Segmented LRU (SLRU) eviction policy to improve hit rates.
- Replaces `m_key_timestamp` with `m_key_metadata` which stores `[segment_id, last_access_time]`.
- **Logic:**
    - The cache is conceptually divided into two segments: **Probationary** (0) and **Protected** (1).
    - **Insert:** New objects are inserted into the Probationary segment (segment 0).
    - **Hit:** Accessing an object promotes it to the Protected segment (segment 1) and updates its timestamp.
    - **Eviction (`evict`):**
        - The Protected segment has a maximum capacity (set to 80% of total cache capacity).
        - If the Protected segment exceeds this limit, the Least Recently Used (LRU) object in the Protected segment is **demoted** to the Probationary segment (reset to segment 0 and given a new timestamp as if just inserted).
        - The eviction victim is then chosen from the Probationary segment (LRU).
        - If the Probationary segment is empty (unlikely given demotion logic, but possible), the victim is chosen from the Protected segment.
- This approach makes the cache resistant to scans (one-time access objects are evicted quickly from Probationary) while keeping popular objects (working set) in the Protected segment.
