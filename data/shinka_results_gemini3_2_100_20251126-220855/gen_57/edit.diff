-    S3-FIFO Eviction Policy:
-    - Keeps a small FIFO queue (S) for new items and a large FIFO queue (M) for popular items.
-    - Uses a Ghost queue (G) to track evicted items from S.
-    - Main queue uses LRU with frequency-based gradual demotion.
+    S3-FIFO with LRU Main and Probabilistic Promotion:
+    - Structure: Small (10%) and Main (90%).
+    - Main Segment: Manages items using LRU (Move-to-MRU on hit).
+      This improves hit rates for workloads with strong temporal locality.
+    - Small Segment: Manages new items using FIFO.
+    - Probabilistic Promotion:
+      - Items in Small usually require a hit (Freq > 0) to be promoted to Main.
+      - We introduce a 1% chance for items to be promoted without a hit.
+      - This allows the cache to adapt to loops/scans larger than the cache size
+        by anchoring a subset of items in the Main segment.
+    - Gradual Demotion:
+      - Items evicted from Main with Freq > 0 are reinserted (Second Chance) and frequency decremented.
