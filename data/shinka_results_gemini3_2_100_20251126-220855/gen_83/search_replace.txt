</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Increase Ghost Registry capacity from 2x to 5x the cache capacity. This aims to capture larger loops (e.g., Trace 14) where the cycle length exceeds the combined size of the cache and a smaller ghost registry.
2. Update the promotion logic from Small to Main. When an item is promoted, set its frequency to 1 instead of 0. This gives promoted items a "survival buffer" equivalent to one clock cycle in the Main queue, aligning their treatment with items rescued from the Ghost registry. This prevents "one-hit wonders" that pass the Small filter from being immediately evicted from Main if they don't get another hit instantly.
