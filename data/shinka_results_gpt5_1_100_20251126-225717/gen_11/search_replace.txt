<DESCRIPTION>
I propose upgrading the current ARC-like SLRU policy with a lightweight decayed frequency component and smarter victim selection. The changes:

1) Add a decayed frequency counter (TinyLFU-style but simple): m_freq tracks per-key frequency, decayed every ~2×capacity accesses to keep counts bounded and adaptive to phase changes. Hits increment frequency, inserts seed a small base frequency.

2) Admission seeding via ghosts and previous strength: When a key is reinserted after eviction, it gets a higher initial frequency if it previously belonged to protected or had higher frequency at eviction (stored in m_ghost_strength). This boosts true working-set items and prevents scan pollution.

3) ARC-like eviction source selection combined with LRFU-style victim choice: Instead of always evicting from probation first, choose between probation and protected based on target sizes (ARC logic), then select the victim with the minimum hybrid priority score S = freq - age/Cap (age = now - last_access_ts). This balances recency and frequency, evicting the coldest item in the chosen segment. Fallback selects globally if a segment is empty.

4) Maintain metadata consistency: Clean m_freq for non-resident keys; ghosts are bounded and we trim ghost_strength together.

This hybrid ARC + decayed LFU scoring improves scan resistance and protects frequently reused items, typically reducing miss rates across mixed workloads without heavy data structures or high overhead.
