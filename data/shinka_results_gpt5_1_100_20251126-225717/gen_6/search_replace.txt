<DESCRIPTION>
I replace the basic 2-segment LRU with an Adaptive Segmented LRU (ARC-inspired) policy:
- Maintain two live segments: probation (T1) and protected (T2).
- Maintain two ghost lists: recently evicted probation (B1) and protected (B2).
- Adapt the target size of the protected segment dynamically (like ARC’s p):
  - On miss/insert, if the key is found in B1, decrease protected target (favor recency/probation).
  - If found in B2, increase protected target (favor frequency/protected).
- On hit in probation, promote to protected and slightly increase protected target.
- Enforce the target by demoting the LRU item from protected to probation as needed.
- Always evict from probation first; if empty, evict from protected; fallback to globally oldest.

This approach resists one-time scans (probation absorbs and gets evicted first), while still promoting reusable items to protected. The adaptive target balances recency vs. frequency per workload using ghost feedback, improving miss rates across diverse traces. The metadata is kept consistent and light: timestamps for recency, sets for segment membership, and bounded ghost dictionaries trimmed to cache capacity.
