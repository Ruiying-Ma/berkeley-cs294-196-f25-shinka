# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Basic Least Recently Used (LRU) Algorithm**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm maintains a dictionary mapping cached keys to their last access count (logical timestamp), updating this value on every hit or insert and evicting the key with the oldest timestamp.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.21, with strong performance on traces exhibiting high temporal locality (up to 0.868) but failing on others.
- **Feedback**: This standard LRU implementation effectively captures recency but suffers significantly on scan-heavy or cyclic workloads (resulting in near-zero hit rates for many traces), suggesting the need for frequency-based or scan-resistant logic.

- **Feedback**: While the Ghost queue improves adaptation to recurring items, the complex demotion logic and frequency capping may lead to inconsistent retention on diverse trace patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 44 - Patch Name conditional_demotion_evict - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Demotion and Ghost Registry**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a probationary small queue and a protected main queue, where items are promoted to main upon hits and demoted back to the small queue rather than immediately evicted.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25, demonstrating strong scan resistance and high hit rates on repetitive traces (up to 0.89) but struggling with sparse data.
- **Feedback**: The implementation adds robustness through M-to-S demotion and ghost entries, though the static queue sizing and specific frequency decay logic may introduce overhead for simple LRU-friendly workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name s3_fifo_demotion_decay - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Ghost Registry and Conditional Demotion**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a small probationary queue (10%) and a large main queue, utilizing a ghost registry to effectively rescue returning evicted items directly to the main queue. It employs conditional demotion where victims from the main queue are only moved to probation if the probationary queue is not full.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.25, showing strong results on recurring loop patterns (e.g., 0.89 hit rate) but performing poorly on scan-heavy workloads (e.g., 0.00 hit rate).
- **Feedback**: While the ghost registry successfully captures looping working sets, the static queue sizing and strict demotion policy limit adaptability, causing the cache to drop useful data too aggressively during scans or sparse access patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 46 - Patch Name s3_fifo_optim - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Frequency Decay and Recursive Demotion**
- **Implementation**: This algorithm extends S3-FIFO by demoting cold items from the Main queue back to the Small (probation) queue instead of evicting them, using a decayed frequency counter to govern promotion and reinsertion.
- **Performance**: The approach achieved a combined score of 0.25, with high hit rates on stable workloads (e.g., 0.89 on trace 28) but poor performance on scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: While the demotion strategy effectively retains warm data in static working sets, the recycling of Main items back to Small appears to hinder the rapid eviction necessary for dynamic or high-churn access patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 47 - Patch Name s3_fifo_decay_demote - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Conditional Demotion and Origin-Aware Ghost**
- **Implementation**: Uses a 10% probation FIFO and a protected Main FIFO, employing a ghost cache that tracks eviction origin to tune readmission frequency. Victims from Main are evicted directly (bypassing probation) if the probation queue is full to prevent pollution during scans.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.25, showing strong locality handling (e.g., 0.89 hit rate) but struggling significantly on specific scan-heavy workloads (near 0% on several traces).
- **Feedback**: While conditional demotion prevents the probation queue from blocking during churn, the aggressive direct eviction and small fixed probation size likely cause thrashing on traces with larger working sets or looping patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 48 - Patch Name s3fifo_cd_og - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Two-Tier Ghost S3-FIFO with Conditional Demotion**
- **Implementation**: Maintains separate ghost registries for Small and Main queues and enforces a two-hit probation filter for promoting items from Small to Main, while conditionally demoting Main items to Small only if space permits.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.21, excelling on specific patterns (e.g., 0.88 hit rate) but failing completely on others (0.00 hit rate).
- **Feedback**: The strict probation mechanism effectively filters one-time access noise but delays the identification of new hot items, and the complex eviction path struggles to adapt quickly to high-churn workloads compared to simpler policies.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 49 - Patch Name 2tg_s3 - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of Generations 40-49, the previous insights, and the code/performance of the Current Best Program, here are the extracted optimization insights.

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Lazy Demotion to Probation:** The top-performing programs (Gen 45, Gen 47, and the **Current Best Program**, Score 0.25) implement a "lazy demotion" strategy. Instead of immediately evicting cold items from the Main queue, they demote them to the Small (probation) queue. This gives items a "second chance" to prove utility against new incoming traffic, outperforming strict eviction policies (Gen 30, Score 0.22).
- **Ghost-Guided Bypass with Extended History:** The **Current Best Program** utilizes a ghost registry with a capacity of `2x` the cache size. Items identified in the ghost registry bypass the probation queue and are inserted directly into the Main queue. This specific implementation detail drives exceptional performance on looping traces (e.g., Trace 28 hit rate of ~0.89 and Trace 27 ~0.82) by recognizing patterns larger than the physical cache.
- **State-Decoupled Frequency Management:** The **Current Best Program** separates frequency tracking (`access_counts` dictionary) from the queue structure. This allows for precise frequency manipulations—specifically resetting frequency to 0 upon demotion (Main -> Small) or promotion (Small -> Main)—ensuring that an item's retention is based on immediate recent utility rather than accumulated stale history.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Strict Two-Hit Probation:** Gen 49 implemented a strict two-hit filter for promoting items from the Small to Main queue and achieved the lowest recent score (0.21). The evaluation feedback indicates this mechanism is too aggressive, delaying the identification of new hot items and causing the cache to miss opportunities on moderate-frequency data.
- **Aggressive Bypass of Probation:** Approaches like Gen 42 and Gen 48 (Score 0.22-0.25) attempted to strictly evict Main items (bypassing the probation queue) if the probation queue was full. While intended to prevent pollution, this often led to premature eviction of useful data during high-pressure phases, resulting in extreme variance and lower consistency compared to the standard demotion logic.
- **Unmitigated Recycling During Scans:** While demotion improves locality scores, the **Current Best Program** reveals a critical flaw: a 0.00% hit rate on Trace 14. The practice of recycling Main items back into the Small queue appears to clog the probation buffer during high-churn scans, effectively blocking new insertions and preventing the cache from adapting to the new working set.

## Implementation Insights
- **Explicit Queue Prioritization:** The **Current Best Program**'s `evict` function enforces a strict hierarchy: `if len(s_queue) > s_capacity or not m_queue`. It *only* considers evicting from the Main queue if the Small queue is within its target size (10%). This code pattern ensures that the probation buffer acts as a strict gatekeeper, prioritizing the stabilization of the Main queue over new arrivals when under pressure.
- **Static Partitioning Stability:** Despite various attempts at complex conditional logic (Gen 40-48), the highest scores consistently come from implementations using a static partition (roughly 10% Small / 90% Main). The stability of a guaranteed protected region (Main) proves more effective for this dataset than dynamic resizing or complex admission policies, which tend to oscillate or converge too slowly.
- **Frequency-Capped Decay:** The **Current Best Program** implements a simple integer-based frequency counter capped at 3. When an item in the Main queue is considered for eviction, if `freq > 0`, it is reinserted with `freq - 1`. This "integer decay" provides a low-overhead aging mechanism that is computationally cheaper than timestamp-based LRU approximations while effectively retaining heavy hitters.

## Performance Analysis
- **The "Loop vs. Scan" Polarization:** The **Current Best Program** demonstrates extreme performance polarization. It achieves near-optimal hit rates on loop-heavy traces (Trace 28: 0.89, Trace 27: 0.82) but fails completely on scan-heavy traces (Trace 14: 0.00). This indicates the current S3-FIFO implementation acts effectively as a "loop detector" but lacks the robustness to handle pure churn, a trade-off that currently yields the highest combined score (0.25).
- **Convergence on 0.25:** Multiple variations (Gen 40, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48) have plateaued at a score of 0.25. This suggests that for the standard S3-FIFO architecture with ghost registries and demotion, the algorithm has reached a local maximum. Further improvements likely require a fundamental change in how high-churn (scan) workloads are handled without sacrificing the "second chance" benefits that boost locality scores.
- **Demotion Value-Add:** Comparing the Current Best (Score 0.25) with earlier non-demotion variants (Gen 30, Score 0.22) confirms that the "Main to Small" demotion path contributes approximately +0.03 to the overall score. This gain is derived almost exclusively from high-locality traces, as the handling of sparse/scan traces remains largely unchanged.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the global insights from Generations 40-49 and the specific performance characteristics of the Current Best Program (Score 0.25), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future mutations. These recommendations focus on fixing the critical "Scan vs. Recycling" conflict while refining the successful ghost and demotion patterns.

1.  **Capacity-Aware Conditional Demotion**
    *Address the 0.00% hit rate on Trace 14.*
    Modify the `evict` function to make the demotion from the Main queue to the Small queue conditional. Currently, the code unconditionally recycles Main victims to `s_queue`. Change this to check `len(s_queue) < s_capacity` (or a slightly higher tolerance like 1.5x capacity) before demoting. If the Small queue is full, evict the Main victim directly to the ghost registry. This prevents cooling items from the Main queue from clogging the probation buffer during high-churn scan phases.

2.  **Tiered Promotion Strategy (Differential Hysteresis)**
    *Refine the "Two-Hit" approach that failed in Gen 49 by respecting history.*
    Implement a promotion threshold where new items require 2 hits to enter the Main queue, while previously demoted items require only 1. This can be achieved by:
    1. Increasing the promotion requirement in `evict` to `freq > 1`.
    2. Initializing new insertions with `freq = 0`.
    3. Initializing items demoted from Main to Small with `freq = 1`.
    4. If an item in Small has `freq == 1` during eviction, move it to the tail (renew probation) instead of evicting.
    This effectively filters "one-hit wonders" from new traffic while giving established heavy-hitters a faster path back to safety.

3.  **Origin-Tracking Ghost Registry**
    *Optimize loop detection by distinguishing strong vs. weak signals.*
    Update the `ghost_registry` to store a boolean flag indicating the source of the evicted item (e.g., `True` for Main, `False` for Small). In `update_after_insert`, use this flag to direct ghost hits: only promote directly to `m_queue` if the ghost originated from the Main queue. If it originated from the Small queue, re-insert it into `s_queue` (probation). This prevents weak signals from bypassing the probation filter while maintaining the "loop shortcut" for high-value data.

4.  **Probabilistic Admission Guard**
    *Harden the cache against synchronized thrashing.*
    In `update_after_insert`, introduce a probabilistic filter when `s_queue` is at or above capacity. Reject new insertions (do not cache them) with a small probability (e.g., 5-10%). This introduces necessary "noise" that prevents the cache eviction cycles from becoming perfectly synchronized with scan patterns, effectively breaking the thrashing loops observed in Trace 14.

5.  **Ghost Capacity Expansion**
    *Leverage the strong "Ghost-Guided" pattern.*
    The Current Best Program shows exceptional performance on large loops (Traces 27 & 28) due to its `2x` ghost capacity. Increase the ghost registry capacity to `3x` or `4x` the cache size. Since ghost entries are metadata-only and cheap, a larger history window allows the algorithm to detect and recover even larger cyclic working sets that exceed the current lookback window, further boosting hit rates on loop-heavy traces.
