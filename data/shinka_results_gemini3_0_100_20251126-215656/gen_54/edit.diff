 # EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 """
-S3-FIFO Cache Eviction Algorithm Implementation.
-Inspired by S3-FIFO (Simple, Scalable, Static) which uses a small FIFO queue (S)
-and a main FIFO queue (M) with re-insertion to approximate LRU with scan resistance
-and frequency awareness.
+Advanced S3-FIFO (AdvS3FIFO)
+Enhancements:
+- Conditional Demotion: M->S demotion only when S is not full. Prevents S pollution.
+- Expanded Ghost: Ghost registry size set to 4x capacity to catch larger loops.
+- Frequency Counters: Uses counters (0-3) for finer granularity.
+- Origin Tracking: Implicitly handles M-evicts by adding to Ghost, ensuring quick recovery.
