conditional_demotion_and_larger_ghost
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Implements conditional demotion in the S3-FIFO eviction policy. When the Main (M) queue selects a victim, it is only demoted to the Small (S) queue if S is not currently full. If S is full, the victim is evicted directly to the ghost registry. This prevents cold items from M from flushing out potentially useful new items in S during high-churn phases (like scans). Additionally, the ghost registry capacity is increased from 2x to 4x cache capacity to better track history for larger working sets or loops.
