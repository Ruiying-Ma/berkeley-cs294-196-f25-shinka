# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Basic Least Recently Used (LRU) Algorithm**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm maintains a dictionary mapping cached keys to their last access count (logical timestamp), updating this value on every hit or insert and evicting the key with the oldest timestamp.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.21, with strong performance on traces exhibiting high temporal locality (up to 0.868) but failing on others.
- **Feedback**: This standard LRU implementation effectively captures recency but suffers significantly on scan-heavy or cyclic workloads (resulting in near-zero hit rates for many traces), suggesting the need for frequency-based or scan-resistant logic.

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Ghost Registry and Conditional Demotion**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a small probationary queue (10%) and a large main queue, utilizing a ghost registry to effectively rescue returning evicted items directly to the main queue. It employs conditional demotion where victims from the main queue are only moved to probation if the probationary queue is not full.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.25, showing strong results on recurring loop patterns (e.g., 0.89 hit rate) but performing poorly on scan-heavy workloads (e.g., 0.00 hit rate).

- **Performance**: The approach achieved a combined score of 0.25, with high hit rates on stable workloads (e.g., 0.89 on trace 28) but poor performance on scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: While the demotion strategy effectively retains warm data in static working sets, the recycling of Main items back to Small appears to hinder the rapid eviction necessary for dynamic or high-churn access patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 47 - Patch Name s3_fifo_decay_demote - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Conditional Demotion and Origin-Aware Ghost**

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the individual program summaries (Generations 60-69) and the implementation of the Current Best Program, here are the optimization insights:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Lazy Demotion with Frequency Reset:** The **Current Best Program** and top-performing variants (Gen 62, Gen 63) utilize a "lazy demotion" strategy where victims from the protected queue (Main) are moved to the probationary queue (Small) with their frequency count reset to 0. This "second chance" mechanism is the primary driver for the exceptional hit rates on static locality traces (Trace 28: 0.89), as it allows fading items to prove utility one last time before eviction.
- **Ghost-Triggered Promotion Bypass:** A highly successful pattern in the **Current Best Program** and Gen 62 is the immediate promotion of Ghost registry hits to the Main queue, bypassing the Small queue entirely. Combined with a large ghost capacity (2x cache size), this enables the cache to capture loops larger than the resident size (Trace 27: 0.82) by short-circuiting the probation logic for known recurring items.
- **Conditional Demotion Logic:** Gen 62 matched the best score (0.25) by implementing a conditional constraint: victims from Main are only demoted to Small *if* the Small queue is under capacity. While the **Current Best Program** performs unconditional demotion, the high performance of Gen 62 suggests that managing the flow into the probation queue is critical to balancing locality retention with scan resistance.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Unconditional Recirculation to Small Queue:** Programs like Gen 66 and Gen 69 (Score 0.24) demonstrated that indiscriminately recycling Main-queue victims back into a fixed-size Small queue causes severe congestion. This approach overcrowds the 10% probation buffer, preventing new items from establishing residency and resulting in near-zero hit rates on scan/churn traces (Trace 14: 0.00).
- **Aggressive "Strict" Probation:** Approaches that placed demoted items or new probationary items at the immediate eviction position (FIFO head) of the Small queue (Gen 67, Gen 68) failed to maintain the working set. This aggressive flushing policy proved too harsh for shifting access patterns, causing regressions in loop-heavy workloads (Trace 12) and capping the score at 0.23.
- **Rigid Static Partitioning:** Feedback from Gen 61 and Gen 65 indicates that a static 10% allocation for the probationary queue is a significant bottleneck when combined with demotion traffic. In dynamic workloads, this small buffer becomes a thrashing point, effectively locking out new data when the Main queue dumps old data into it.

## Implementation Insights
- **Strict Queue Prioritization:** The **Current Best Program** implements a `while True` eviction loop that strictly prioritizes clearing the Small queue (`if len(s_queue) > s_capacity`) before even considering the Main queue. This implementation detail effectively turns the Small queue into a filter that protects the Main queue from scan pollution, provided the Main queue isn't actively flooding the Small queue with demotions.
- **Decoupled Frequency Management:** The **Current Best Program** uses a standalone `access_counts` dictionary rather than embedding frequency bits in queue objects. This allows for efficient "Integer Decay" (decrementing `freq` on Main re-insertion) and immediate "Reset" (setting `freq` to 0 on demotion) without complex object manipulation, a pattern that stabilized performance across generations.
- **Ghost-as-Ticket Mechanism:** The specific implementation of `update_after_insert` in the **Current Best Program** treats *any* presence in the `ghost_registry` as a ticket to the Main queue (`m_queue[obj.key] = None`). This binary check, rather than complex origin tracking (tried in earlier generations), proved sufficient and highly effective for loop detection.

## Performance Analysis
- **The 0.25 Score Plateau:** A clear ceiling has emerged where Generations 60-69 oscillate between 0.23 and 0.25. The **Current Best Program** and Gen 62/63 represent a local maximum for this architecture. The inability to break 0.25 suggests a fundamental trade-off is currently locked in: aggressive demotion boosts static locality (Trace 28) but destroys scan resistance (Trace 14).
- **Locality vs. Churn Trade-off:** The performance profile of the **Current Best Program** is highly polarized. It achieves near-optimal results on frequency-heavy traces (0.89 on Trace 28) but fails completely on high-churn scans (0.00 on Trace 14). Comparisons with Gen 67 (Score 0.23) show that attempts to improve scan resistance (via rapid demotion) generally lead to a disproportionate loss in locality scores.
- **Ghost Capacity Correlation:** There is a direct correlation between ghost registry size and loop trace performance. Programs with extended ghost capacities (Current Best with 2x, Gen 64 with 5x) consistently score >0.75 on Traces 27 and 34, whereas variants with standard or smaller ghost implementations struggle to identify these longer reuse patterns.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of Generations 60-69 and the performance profile of the Current Best Program (specifically its 0.00 hit rate on scan traces vs. 0.89 on locality traces), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future mutations:

1.  **Capacity-Gated Conditional Demotion**
    Implement a conditional check before demoting items from the Main queue to the Small queue. In the `evict` function, change the unconditional demotion logic to: `if len(s_queue) < s_capacity: demote_to_small() else: demote_to_ghost()`. This modification, observed in the high-performing Gen 62, prevents "recycling" operations from overcrowding the probationary queue during high-churn scans, thereby fixing the 0.00% hit rate on Trace 14 while preserving locality for stable workloads.

2.  **Extended Ghost Registry Capacity**
    Increase the capacity of the `ghost_registry` from `2x` to `4x` or `5x` the cache size. The global analysis indicates a direct correlation between ghost history size and loop detection scores (Traces 27 and 34). Since ghost entries are metadata-only and inexpensive, expanding this window allows the algorithm to detect and rescue items from much larger working sets that exceed the physical cache size.

3.  **Probabilistic Probation Admission**
    Introduce a probabilistic filter for new items when the Small queue is at capacity. In `update_after_insert`, if `len(s_queue) >= s_capacity` and the item is not in the ghost registry, admit the item with a low probability (e.g., 25%) and drop it otherwise. This "Scan Resistance" mechanism breaks the synchronization between eviction and insertion during scans, preventing the "lock-out" effect where useful data is unable to enter a thrashing probation queue.

4.  **Tiered Promotion Frequencies (Tenancy Bonus)**
    Differentiate the starting frequency of items entering the Main queue to improve retention stability. When promoting an item from the Ghost registry (a strong signal of recurrence), set `access_counts[key] = 2`. When promoting from the Small queue (a weaker signal), set `access_counts[key] = 1`. This gives proven items a "buffer" against immediate decay, stabilizing the Main queue against the aggressive eviction pressure noted in "Ineffective Approaches."

5.  **Expanded Probationary Allocation**
    Increase the static allocation of the Small queue from `0.1` (10%) to `0.2` (20%) of the total cache capacity. Analysis of Gen 61 and Gen 65 suggests that the strict 10% partition creates a bottleneck that triggers excessive thrashing when combined with demotion traffic. A slightly larger probationary buffer allows new items more time to accumulate the hits necessary for promotion without significantly reducing the protected Main capacity.
