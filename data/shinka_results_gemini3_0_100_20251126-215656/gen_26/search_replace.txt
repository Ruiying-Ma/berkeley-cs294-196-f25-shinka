optimize_s3_fifo_hysteresis
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Implements an optimized S3-FIFO algorithm with the following improvements:
1.  **Frequency-Gated Promotion (Hysteresis):** Items in the Small (S) queue require two hits (or survival through two passes) to be promoted to Main (M). This prevents "one-hit wonders" from polluting the protected Main queue. Implemented using a `probation_set`.
2.  **Removal of Demotion:** Removed the demotion path from M to S. Victims from M are evicted (and added to Ghost) rather than moved to S. This prevents cold data from M clogging the S queue, improving scan resistance.
3.  **Expanded Ghost Registry:** Evictions from M are now also added to the Ghost registry. This helps recover items from large working sets (loops > cache size) that would otherwise be lost.
