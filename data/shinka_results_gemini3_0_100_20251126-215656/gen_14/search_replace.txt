<DESCRIPTION>
Implements an Adaptive S3-FIFO algorithm inspired by ARC.
1. Introduces `s_ratio` to dynamically size the probation queue (S) vs protected queue (M), replacing the static 10% split.
2. Adds a secondary ghost registry (`ghost_m`) to track items evicted from M.
3. Adapts `s_ratio` based on ghost hits: rescue from S-ghost increases S size (S was too small), rescue from M-ghost decreases S size (M was too small).
4. Increases ghost registry capacity to 2x cache size to capture longer historical patterns (Recommendation 2).
This allows the cache to tune itself to scan-heavy vs recency-heavy workloads.
