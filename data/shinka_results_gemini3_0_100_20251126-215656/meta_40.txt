# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Basic Least Recently Used (LRU) Algorithm**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm maintains a dictionary mapping cached keys to their last access count (logical timestamp), updating this value on every hit or insert and evicting the key with the oldest timestamp.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.21, with strong performance on traces exhibiting high temporal locality (up to 0.868) but failing on others.
- **Feedback**: This standard LRU implementation effectively captures recency but suffers significantly on scan-heavy or cyclic workloads (resulting in near-zero hit rates for many traces), suggesting the need for frequency-based or scan-resistant logic.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hyperbolic Caching with Persistent Frequency History**
- **Implementation**: Calculates eviction scores as `Frequency / (CurrentTime - LastAccessTime)` to evict the lowest-scored item, while permanently retaining frequency counts for evicted keys to prioritize returning objects.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.23, with hit rates varying drastically from 0.00 to 0.88 depending on the workload trace.
- **Feedback**: While the approach balances recency and frequency, the O(N) linear scan for eviction is inefficient, and the algorithm struggles to adapt to scan-heavy or rapidly changing workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name hyperbolic_caching_with_history - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO Eviction with Ghost Registry**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes three `OrderedDict` structures to manage a small probationary FIFO, a main FIFO, and a ghost history, promoting items to the main queue based on access bits and prior eviction history.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25, showing strong scan resistance on looping traces (up to 89% hit rate) but lower efficiency on highly random workloads.
- **Feedback**: The ghost registry effectively filters one-hit wonders by distinguishing frequency, though the static 10% allocation for the probationary queue may limit adaptability compared to dynamic resizing policies.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the detailed analysis of Generations 30-39 and the provided Current Best Program (an S3-FIFO variant with Demotion and Ghost), here are the extracted optimization insights.

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Static Partitioning with Lazy Demotion**: The most successful approach (Gen 38 and the Current Best Program, Score 0.25) combines a fixed 90/10 split (Main/Small) with a "lazy demotion" policy. Instead of evicting cold items from the Main queue directly, they are demoted to the tail of the Small queue. This outperforms simple eviction (Gen 30, Score 0.22) by providing a second chance for cooling items to re-prove their utility.
- **Ghost-Triggered Bypass**: The Current Best Program utilizes a ghost registry to bypass the probation queue entirely. If a key is found in the ghost registry (indicating recent eviction), it is promoted directly to the Main queue. This mechanism is crucial for recovering looping patterns larger than the cache size, driving high scores on Traces 27 and 28.
- **Frequency Reset on Transfer**: Both Gen 36 (Frequency Decay) and the Current Best Program implement a policy where an item's frequency count is reset (e.g., to 0) when it moves between queues (Small to Main, or Main to Small). This ensures that retention is based on *current* utility rather than accumulated history, preventing stale heavy hitters from clogging the cache.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Adaptive Queue Sizing**: Despite multiple attempts to implement dynamic resizing based on ghost hits (Gen 31, 32, 34, 35, 39), these algorithms consistently plateaued at scores of 0.23-0.24. The evaluation feedback indicates that the adaptive logic is either too slow to converge or becomes unstable in the face of the dataset's rapid phase changes, failing to beat the static 10% probation baseline.
- **Strict Filtering without Recourse**: Gen 30 implemented a strict two-hit promotion threshold without a demotion mechanism, resulting in a lower score (0.22). While this filtered one-time scans effectively, it was too aggressive for moderate reuse patterns, starving the Main queue.
- **Uncontrolled Recycling on Scans**: While the demotion strategy improves the overall score, the trace-level breakdown of the Current Best Program reveals a critical weakness: hit rates drop to 0.00 on scan-heavy traces (Traces 14-19). Recycling cold Main items back to Small clogs the probation queue, effectively blocking new insertions during high-churn phases.

## Implementation Insights
- **Conditional Eviction Hierarchy**: The Current Best Program's `evict` function enforces a strict hierarchy. It prioritizes checking the Small queue (`if len(_s3_small) > s_target`). It *only* examines the Main queue if the Small queue is within its target size. This logic implicitly prioritizes maintaining the probation buffer for new arrivals over retaining old Main items, unless the buffer is empty.
- **Extended Ghost Capacity**: The successful implementation explicitly defines the ghost registry capacity as `cache_snapshot.capacity * 2`. This 2x window is a specific implementation detail that allows the algorithm to detect and recover looping patterns that are up to twice the size of the cache, which a standard 1x ghost queue would miss.
- **State-Decoupled Frequency Tracking**: The best code uses a separate `_s3_freq` dictionary to track access counts (capped at 3) rather than storing this state within the queue objects. This separation simplifies the logic for resetting frequency during demotion (Main -> Small) or promotion, ensuring clear state transitions without modifying queue integrity.

## Performance Analysis
- **Static vs. Adaptive Ceiling**: There is a confirmed performance ceiling for adaptive algorithms on this dataset. Static variants (Gen 36, 38) consistently reach a score of 0.25, while adaptive variants (Gen 34, 35, 39) struggle to exceed 0.23. The stability of a guaranteed protected region appears more valuable than the theoretical flexibility of dynamic sizing for these workloads.
- **Polarized Specialization**: The Current Best Program achieves its high score through extreme specialization. It dominates on specific looping traces (0.89 on Trace 28, 0.83 on Trace 27) but fails completely on sparse workloads (0.00 on Trace 14). This suggests the algorithm effectively acts as a "loop detector" but lacks robustness for pure scanning patterns.
- **Demotion Value Add**: Comparing Gen 30 (No demotion, Score 0.22) with Gen 38/Best Program (Demotion, Score 0.25) quantifies the value of the "second chance" mechanism at roughly +0.03 points. This gain comes almost exclusively from improved retention on high-locality traces, as scan performance remains poor.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of Generations 30-39 and the specific weaknesses of the Current Best Program (0.00% hit rate on scan traces), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future mutations:

1.  **Capacity-Aware Conditional Demotion**
    The current "blind" demotion of all Main queue victims into the Small queue causes severe clogging during scan phases (Trace 14). Modify the `evict` function to make demotion conditional: only recycle a victim from `_s3_main` to `_s3_small` if `len(_s3_small) < s_target`. If the Small queue is already at or above capacity, evict the Main victim directly. This prevents cold data from the Main queue from suffocating new insertions during high-churn periods.

2.  **Probationary Hysteresis (Two-Hit Promotion)**
    To filter out weak signals and "one-hit wonders" that pollute the protected Main queue, implement a stricter promotion policy. Modify the logic in `_s3_small` to require two hits (frequency > 1) for promotion to `_s3_main`. On the first hit, simply move the item to the tail of `_s3_small` (renew probation). This effectively reserves the Main queue for items with proven recurrence.

3.  **Origin-Based Ghost Handling**
    Refine the ghost registry to track the source of evicted items (e.g., store `True` if evicted from Main, `False` if from Small). Modify `update_after_insert` to use this metadata: only allow a direct bypass to `_s3_main` if the ghost originated from Main. Ghosts that originated from Small should be re-inserted into `_s3_small`. This maintains the algorithm's loop-detecting strength for established data while preventing scan cycling.

4.  **Frequency Inheritance on Demotion**
    Currently, items demoted from Main to Small have their frequency reset to 0, making them immediate candidates for eviction in the Small queue. Change this to initialize the frequency of demoted items to 1 (or a dedicated "grace" value). This provides a "soft landing," giving cooling heavy-hitters a fair survival window against completely new, cold insertions in the probation queue.

5.  **Probabilistic Admission Filter**
    To further harden the algorithm against pure scan workloads where the cache thrashes, add a probabilistic guard at the entry. When `_s3_small` is full, reject new insertions with a small probability (e.g., 5-10%). This seemingly counter-intuitive noise prevents the cache from becoming perfectly synchronized with a scan pattern, creating "breathing room" for the probation queue to identify valid working sets.
