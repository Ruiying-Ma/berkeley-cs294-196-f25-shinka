S3FIFO_Ghost4x_Freq2
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Implements an enhanced S3-FIFO algorithm with three key improvements:
1.  **Extended Ghost Registry (4x Capacity)**: Significantly increases the history window to capture larger working sets and loops (like Trace 14, 27, 28) that exceed the cache size but fit within an extended history.
2.  **2-Bit Frequency Tracking**: Replaces simple "accessed bits" with a frequency counter (0-3). This enables finer-grained filtering of items.
3.  **Adaptive Tiered Promotion**: Implements a dynamic promotion threshold. When the Main queue (M) is filling up (< 50%), items promote on a single hit (Standard S3-FIFO). When M is under pressure, items in the Small queue (S) require 2 hits (`freq >= 2`) to promote. Items with 1 hit are given a "Second Chance" in S (reinserted with reset frequency) rather than being promoted or evicted immediately. This filters "one-hit wonders" effectively while ensuring the cache is utilized.
