<DESCRIPTION>
Implement conditional demotion for the Main queue and increase ghost registry capacity.
1. In `evict`, when selecting a victim from the Main queue (M), check if the Small queue (S) has space (is below its target capacity). If S is full, evict the M-victim directly instead of demoting it to S. This prevents aging items from M from flushing out new items in S, improving scan resistance.
2. When evicting directly from M, add the victim to the ghost registry to maintain history, allowing it to be promoted if accessed again soon.
3. Increase the ghost registry capacity limit from 2x to 4x the cache capacity to better detect and handle larger working sets or looping patterns.
