 # EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 """
-Smart S3-FIFO (SmartS3FIFO)
-Enhancements:
-- Conditional Demotion: M->S demotion only when S is under capacity.
-- Strict Eviction: Direct M eviction when S is full.
-- Ghost Registry: Tracks S evictions to rescue false negatives.
-- Frequency Map: Uses integer counters instead of bits for future extensibility.
+Smart S3-FIFO (SmartS3FIFO) v2
+Improvements:
+- Adaptive Sizing: Increased S queue allocation (20%) to absorb scans better.
+- Extended Ghost: Larger history (4x) to catch longer loops.
+- Ghost Rescue Bonus: Items rescued from Ghost enter M with a 'warm' status (freq=1).
+- Global Reset: Handles sequential trace execution safely.
