reset_scan_ghost_tuning
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
1.  **State Reset**: Re-implemented state reset logic (`_reset_if_needed`) to ensure sequential traces (like Trace 14 following Trace 13) start with clean metadata, fixing potential pollution issues.
2.  **Scan Guard (Probabilistic Admission)**: In `update_after_insert`, if the probationary queue (S) is full, new items are inserted at the HEAD (immediate eviction candidate) with 75% probability, and TAIL (standard probation) with 25% probability. This prevents scan workloads (Trace 14) from flushing valuable items from S and M, while still allowing some new items to prove themselves.
3.  **Extended Ghost Registry**: Increased ghost capacity from 2x to 4x of cache size to better capture larger working sets and loops (Trace 27, 34).
4.  **Frequency Tuning**: Increased max frequency cap from 3 to 7 to better distinguish hot items.
