<DESCRIPTION>
Implements three improvements to the S3-FIFO algorithm:
1. Capacity-Gated Conditional Demotion: When evicting from Main (M), items are only demoted to Small (S) if S is under capacity. Otherwise, they are evicted directly. This prevents M items from polluting S during scans.
2. Extended Ghost Registry: Increases ghost registry capacity from 2x to 4x the cache size to better capture larger working sets and loops.
3. Tiered Initial Frequency (Simulated): Items promoted from Ghost to Main start with their access bit set ("hot"), giving them a higher survival probability (frequency bonus) compared to standard insertions.
