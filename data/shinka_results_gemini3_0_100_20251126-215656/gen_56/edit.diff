 # EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 """
-Optimized S3-FIFO (Simple, Scalable, Static) with Conditional Demotion.
-Implements a segmented cache with a small probationary queue (S) and a main protected queue (M).
-Key Features:
-- Conditional Demotion: M-victims are only demoted to S if S is not full, preserving S for new insertions.
-- Ghost Registry: Tracks evicted items to rescue returning loop patterns directly to M.
-- One-Hit Promotion: Simplifies promotion logic to capture working sets faster.
-- Auto-Reset: Detects new trace starts to clear global state.
+Adaptive S3-FIFO with Conditional Demotion (AS3-CD)
+Combines the adaptive sizing of ARC/A-S3-FIFO with the conditional demotion strategy.
+- S/M Queues: Partitioned cache.
+- Adaptive Sizing: s_dist adjusts based on ghost hits to find optimal S/M split.
+- Conditional Demotion: M-victims are demoted to S (giving a second chance) only if S is under its target size. 
+  Otherwise, they are evicted to Ghost M.
+- Ghost S: Tracks items evicted from S. Hits -> Grow S.
+- Ghost M: Tracks items evicted from M (when S was full). Hits -> Grow M (Shrink S).
