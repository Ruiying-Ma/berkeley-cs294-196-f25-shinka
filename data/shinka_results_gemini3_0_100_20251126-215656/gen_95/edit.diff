-# S3-FIFO with Demotion and State Reset (s3fifo_robust_demotion)
-# Combines S3-FIFO-D logic with robust state management.
-# - s_queue: Small/Probationary FIFO queue (10% capacity)
-# - m_queue: Main/Protected FIFO queue (90% capacity)
-# - g_queue: Ghost FIFO queue (2x capacity)
-# - freq: Frequency counter map (capped at 3)
+# S3-FIFO with Ghost-Gated Admission (s3fifo_ghost_gated)
+#
+# A robust cache eviction algorithm designed for scan resistance and loop capturing.
+# Components:
+# 1. Filter Queue (F): 
+#    - Entry point for all NEW items (not in history).
+#    - Serves as a "Gate". Items here are transient and evicted with highest priority.
+#    - A hit in Filter promotes the item to Main, proving usefulness.
+# 2. Small Queue (S):
+#    - Probationary queue (5% of capacity).
+#    - Receives items demoted from Main. Gives them a "second chance".
+# 3. Main Queue (M):
+#    - Protected queue (95% logical capacity).
+#    - Items persist here based on frequency.
+# 4. Ghost Registry (G):
+#    - Tracks history of evicted items (5x capacity).
+#    - Re-insertion of a Ghost item bypasses Filter and goes to Main (Loop capture).
