 # EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 """
-S3-FIFO Cache Eviction Algorithm Implementation.
-Inspired by S3-FIFO (Simple, Scalable, Static) which uses a small FIFO queue (S)
-and a main FIFO queue (M) with re-insertion to approximate LRU with scan resistance
-and frequency awareness.
+Robust S3-FIFO (RobustS3FIFO)
+Combines the high-performance "Always Demote" strategy of the current implementation
+with the robustness of global state resetting from the Optimized variant.
+Increases ghost registry size to improve long-range loop detection.
