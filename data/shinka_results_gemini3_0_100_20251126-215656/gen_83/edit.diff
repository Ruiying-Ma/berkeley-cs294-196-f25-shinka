 # EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 """
 Smart S3-FIFO (SmartS3FIFO)
 Enhancements:
 - Conditional Demotion: M->S demotion only when S is under capacity.
 - Strict Eviction: Direct M eviction when S is full.
 - Ghost Registry: Tracks S evictions to rescue false negatives.
 - Frequency Map: Uses integer counters instead of bits for future extensibility.
