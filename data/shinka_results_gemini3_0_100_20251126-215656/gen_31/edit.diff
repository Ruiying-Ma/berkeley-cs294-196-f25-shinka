 """
 Dynamic S3-FIFO (DynS3FIFO)
 An enhanced S3-FIFO algorithm with dynamic partition sizing (ARC-like adaptation).
 Features:
 1. Two queues: Small (S) and Main (M).
 2. Ghost registries for both queues to track evicted items.
 3. Dynamic S-queue sizing based on ghost hits (marginal utility).
 4. Strict promotion: S -> M only on eviction + access bit.
 5. Large ghost history (2x capacity) to catch larger loops.
