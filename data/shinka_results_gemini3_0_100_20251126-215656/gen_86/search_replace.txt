s3_fifo_multibit_expanded_ghost
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Implements S3-FIFO with multi-bit frequency tracking (0-3), expanded ghost registry (3x capacity), and tenancy-aware promotion.
- Replaces the binary `accessed_bits` set with an `access_counts` dictionary to allow fine-grained frequency tracking and decay (max freq 3).
- Increases `ghost_registry` capacity to 3x cache size to better capture long loops and recurring items in scan-heavy traces (addressing Trace 14 and 29).
- Modifies promotion logic: Items promoted from Small or rescued from Ghost start with frequency 0 in Main, ensuring they are protected for at least one full FIFO traversal but must receive hits to accumulate higher frequency and stay longer.
- Preserves the "Conditional Demotion" logic which protects the Small queue from pollution by demoted Main items when it is full.

# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
"""
Optimized S3-FIFO (Simple, Scalable, Static) with Conditional Demotion.
Implements a segmented cache with a small probationary queue (S) and a main protected queue (M).
Key Features:
- Conditional Demotion: M-victims are only demoted to S if S is not full, preserving S for new insertions.
- Ghost Registry: Tracks evicted items to rescue returning loop patterns directly to M.
- One-Hit Promotion: Simplifies promotion logic to capture working sets faster.
- Auto-Reset: Detects new trace starts to clear global state.

"""
S3-FIFO with Multi-bit Frequency, Expanded Ghost, and Tenancy-Aware Promotion.
Improvements:
1. Replaces boolean 'accessed_bits' with 'access_counts' (0-3) to distinguish hotness.
2. Expands Ghost Registry to 3x capacity to capture longer loops (Trace 14/29).
3. Tenancy-Aware: Rescued items start in Main with freq=0 (one pass protection),
   while hits in Main accumulate frequency for stronger resistance.
