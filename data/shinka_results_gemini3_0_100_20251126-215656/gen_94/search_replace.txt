enhanced_s3fifo_ghost_freq
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Implements an enhanced S3-FIFO algorithm with the following improvements:
1. Replaces the binary `accessed_bits` with a `freq_map` (capped at 3) to better distinguish item popularity.
2. Increases `ghost_registry` capacity to 10x cache capacity to capture longer looping patterns (Trace 14/scans).
3. Implements strict conditional demotion: Items evicted from Main (M) queue are only demoted to Small (S) queue if S is below its target capacity (10%). Otherwise, they are evicted directly and added to the ghost registry.
4. Adds M-evicted items to the ghost registry to maintain history for working sets larger than the cache but smaller than the ghost registry.
