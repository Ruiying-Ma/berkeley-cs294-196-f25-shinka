 # EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 """
-Optimized S3-FIFO (Simple, Scalable, Static) with Conditional Demotion.
-Implements a segmented cache with a small probationary queue (S) and a main protected queue (M).
-Key Features:
-- Conditional Demotion: M-victims are only demoted to S if S is not full, preserving S for new insertions.
-- Ghost Registry: Tracks evicted items to rescue returning loop patterns directly to M.
-- One-Hit Promotion: Simplifies promotion logic to capture working sets faster.
-- Auto-Reset: Detects new trace starts to clear global state.
+Two-Tier Ghost S3-FIFO (2TG-S3)
+Refines S3-FIFO with:
+1. Two-Tier Ghost Registry: Distinguishes ghosts from Small vs Main queues to enable origin-aware rescue.
+2. Two-Hit Probation: Requires two hits in the Small queue for promotion, filtering weak signals.
+3. Frequency Inheritance: Demoted Main items receive a 'credit', allowing quicker promotion if reused.
+4. Conditional Demotion: Main items are only demoted to Small if space permits, preventing scan pollution.
