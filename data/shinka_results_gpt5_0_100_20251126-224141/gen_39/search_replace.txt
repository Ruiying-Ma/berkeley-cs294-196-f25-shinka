arc_stream_clamp_and_strict_replace
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I keep the ARC core but tighten two parts where drift and scans hurt hit rates:

1) Make evict strictly follow ARC’s REPLACE rule, removing the timestamp-based fallback. If resident lists are empty due to rare drift, we resync once and deterministically pick from T1 then T2, else take the first cache key. This avoids non-deterministic aging paths that can undermine ARC’s balance and p-steering.

2) Add a streaming-aware, progressive clamp to p in update_after_insert. When we observe long streaks of entirely new keys (cold_streak), we reduce p earlier and in controlled steps (at ≈C and again at 2C) to bias toward recency and protect the cache from scan pollution, but without the overshoot of very aggressive clamping. This preserves the gains we saw from gentler adaptation while improving the mid-tier traces that suffer from long cold runs.

These changes keep ARC mechanics intact, improve robustness, and reduce miss rates on scan-heavy workloads while maintaining good performance on mixed traces.
