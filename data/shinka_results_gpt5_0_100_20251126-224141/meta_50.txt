# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Access-Count LRU Eviction**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a global key→timestamp map updated on every hit/insert using cache_snapshot.access_count; on eviction, selects the cached key with the smallest timestamp (ties implicitly broken by cache iteration order). Metadata for evicted keys is purged to keep the map in sync.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.21 across 48 traces, with hit rates ranging from 0.0000 to 0.8680.
- **Feedback**: Behavior matches pure LRU—strong on workloads with temporal locality (several mid-to-high hit-rate traces) but weak on scans, large working sets, or frequency-skewed patterns (many near-zero traces). Incorporating frequency/adaptive components (e.g., 2Q/ARC/LRFU) or scan resistance could improve robustness across diverse workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC)**
- **Implementation**: Uses OrderedDicts for ARC’s T1/T2 (in-cache) and B1/B2 (ghost) lists, with p (target T1 size) initialized to half capacity and bounded to the live cache size. Eviction follows ARC’s replace heuristic (B2 ghost hits bias evicting from T1), hits promote to T2 MRU, inserts go to T1 unless in ghosts (which adjust p), and desync fallbacks promote hits to T2 and place unknown evictions into B1; ghost lists are trimmed to capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces, with hit rates ranging from 0.00 to 0.89 (strong on traces 27/28/34/38, weak on several low-locality/scan traces).
- **Feedback**: Ghost-driven adaptation and p tuning help on mixed recency/frequency workloads but struggle on scan-like or highly unique streams. Integer rounding and default promotion to T2 on desync may over-bias frequency and reduce T1 headroom; gentler p updates or stricter T1 defaults could stabilize performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name arc_adaptive_recency_frequency - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: 80/20 SLRU-style two-segment cache**
- **Implementation**: Uses per-key last-access timestamps (from access_count) and a two-segment design: new items enter probation, first hit promotes to protected, and an LRU demotion enforces a protected cap at 80% of capacity. Eviction selects the LRU from probation first, otherwise the global LRU; metadata is fully cleaned on evict.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23 across 48 traces, with strong hit rates on locality-heavy traces (up to 0.8872) but many traces near zero.
- **Feedback**: The static 80% protected quota and immediate promotion after one hit help reuse-heavy workloads but reduce adaptability, over-protecting items and underperforming on scans/random patterns. Absence of admission control or ghost history limits discrimination between transient and recurring items, leading to many low-hit results.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name slru_promotion_with_quota - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: 2Q Segmented LRU with freq tiebreak**
- **Implementation**: Implements a 2Q-style cache with probation (A1) and protected (Am) segments, promoting items to Am on first hit and tracking recency via access_count-based timestamps. Eviction picks a segment targeting ~25% A1, then evicts the segment LRU with frequency as a tiebreaker; metadata is stored in global dicts and cleaned on eviction.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23; strong on reusable/looping traces (peaks up to 0.8874) but many traces are low, including some near-zero.
- **Feedback**: The segment choice effectively evicts from A1 even when A1 is below the target, over-protecting Am and harming adaptability to scans/phase shifts; the frequency tiebreak likely rarely activates due to unique timestamps. Correcting the segment-selection branch to truly enforce the A1 target or dynamically sizing segments (e.g., with ghost history) could improve robustness across workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name segmented_lru_2q_promotion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Simplified ARC with Ghost Sets**
- **Implementation**: ARC-like T1/T2 resident lists and B1/B2 ghost lists with access_count-based LRU; evicts from T1 when T1 exceeds adaptive target p (or on B2 hints), else from T2; hits promote to T2, and p adapts on ghost hits using |B2|/|B1| ratios while pruning ghosts to capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces, with hit rates ranging from 0.00 to 0.89 (strong on several traces, moderate to low on many others).
- **Feedback**: Performs well on workloads mixing recency and frequency, but struggles on scan/low-reuse patterns, exhibiting high variance. Simplifications (always promoting to T2, shared ghost cap, coarse replace rule) likely induce T2 pollution and limit responsiveness to scans.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 4 - Patch Name arc_simplified_segmented_lru - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC-inspired adaptive cache eviction**
- **Implementation**: Implements a simplified ARC using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) with an adaptive target arc_p; metadata is resynced with the actual cache on eviction and timestamps serve as a fallback tie-breaker. Hits promote keys to T2 MRU, inserts adjust arc_p based on ghost hits, and new keys enter T1; ghost lists are trimmed to capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.25 over 48 traces; per-trace hit rates ranged from 0.0000 to 0.8915.
- **Feedback**: Strong on workloads with stable recency/frequency (e.g., traces 27, 28, 34, 38) but weak on scan-like or adversarial patterns (many traces below 0.1). Always promoting hits to T2 and capping ghost sizes at capacity may over-bias frequency and dampen adaptability despite consistent metadata via resync.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 5 - Patch Name arc_with_ghost_lists - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC-TinyLFU Hybrid Cache**
- **Implementation**: Combines ARC (OrderedDict-based T1/T2 with ghost lists B1/B2) with a decaying TinyLFU-style frequency sketch and LRU timestamps for tie-breaking. arc_p adapts on ghost hits; eviction compares the LRU of T1 vs T2 using arc_p and per-key frequencies; hits promote to T2, inserts respect ghost membership, and evictions update ghost lists with ghost sizes trimmed to capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23 across 48 traces, with hit rates ranging from 0.0 to 0.8864 (strong on traces 27/28/34/38 and moderate ~0.45–0.53 on several, but very low on many others).
- **Feedback**: The ARC plus ghost-based adaptation benefits workloads with recurring locality, but the simplistic frequency sketch and considering only each segment’s LRU as eviction candidates leads to high variance and weak results on low-locality/streaming traces. Tuning admission (e.g., stronger TinyLFU gate), decay cadence, and reducing reliance on periodic resync could improve robustness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 6 - Patch Name arc_tiny_lfu_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid ARC-inspired Segmented LRU with Ghosts**
- **Implementation**: Two-tier (A1 probation, Am protected) LRU with per-key timestamps, light frequency counts, and ghost histories (A1/Am) that adapt an A1 target size; eviction selects a segment via the adaptive target and picks the LRU key with frequency as a tiebreaker. Hits promote to protected; inserts adjust the target if ghosts indicate prior residency, and ghost lists are trimmed with a size-bound.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23 across 48 traces; hit rates ranged from 0.0000 to 0.8910 (notably ~0.49–0.54 on traces 1–10 and 0.891 on trace_28).
- **Feedback**: Ghost-driven adaptation and first-hit promotion work well on reuse-heavy workloads (e.g., traces 27, 28, 34, 38), but performance collapses on streaming/low-reuse traces (many near-zero results). Strengthening scan resistance/demotion or aging and enriching the frequency signal could reduce protected-set stickiness and improve robustness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 7 - Patch Name arc_srlu_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Segmented LRU (SLRU) Cache Eviction**
- **Implementation**: Implements SLRU using two sets (probationary/protected) and a global timestamp map updated on each access. Eviction chooses the LRU from probationary, else protected, else global; hits promote to protected and a fixed 0.8 protected cap triggers demotions, with periodic cleanup against current cache keys.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23 across 48 traces; hit rates spanned near-zero on scan/low-locality traces to 0.88 on high-locality traces (notably traces 27–28, 34, 38).
- **Feedback**: Shielding benefited stable-reuse workloads, but the static protected ratio and absence of adaptive/ghost admission limited performance under scans and shifting working sets. Linear LRU searches are simple but may be inefficient and less responsive; tuning the protected size or adding adaptive admission could improve robustness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name slru_promotion_with_lru_demote - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC+TinyLFU Hybrid Eviction**
- **Implementation**: Combines ARC (T1/T2 with ghost lists B1/B2 and adaptive target p) with a TinyLFU-style frequency sketch, decayed every 10k accesses, using timestamps as a tie-breaker. Eviction samples up to 3 LRU candidates from T1/T2, prefers ARC’s chosen segment but can override based on frequency gaps; metadata is resynced to the cache and p is adjusted at most once per access.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23; hit rates ranged from 0.0000 to 0.8910 across 48 traces.
- **Feedback**: Strong on workloads with recurring locality and frequency skew, but weak on scans or large, sparse working sets. The small sample size (S=3) and relatively slow decay window can misjudge recency/frequency, leading to suboptimal victim selection in volatile patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 9 - Patch Name arc_tinylfu_sampling - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid ARC + LFU Aging Cache**
- **Implementation**: Maintains ARC-style resident sets (T1 probationary LRU, T2 protected) and ghost sets (B1/B2) with adaptive target p; replace() evicts from T1 by LRU when T1>p/B2-hit/empty-T2, otherwise from T2 by lowest aged frequency with LRU tiebreaker. T2 uses capped per-key frequencies aged by staleness over a capacity-scaled window; ghost lists are timestamped and pruned to 2×capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces, peaking near 0.89 on locality-heavy traces but dropping near zero on many low-locality/scan-like traces.
- **Feedback**: Adaptive p via ghost hits and LFU-with-aging improves robustness and yields strong gains on reuse-heavy workloads. However, unconditional T1→T2 promotion and conservative aging (window≈capacity/2, no demotion) can overprotect stale items, hurting scans and rapidly shifting patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 10 - Patch Name arc_lfu_hybrid_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive ARC with Delayed Promotion**
- **Implementation**: Simplified ARC maintaining T1/T2 residents and B1/B2 ghosts, with per-key timestamp LRU and replace() evicting from T1 when |T1|>p, when the incoming key is in B2 and |T1|≥p, or when T2 is empty. Adaptive target p starts at capacity/2, adjusts on ghost hits with damped steps, slowly decays without ghost hits and under scan clamp, and uses delayed T2 promotion requiring two hits within a short window.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces; hit rates span 0.0000 to 0.8889 with several mid-0.4–0.5 cases and a few strong (≥0.7) traces.
- **Feedback**: The design adapts well to recurring/frequent reuse, but struggles on scans and sparse or long-gap two-touch patterns. Conservative delayed promotion and ratio-damped p updates likely slow adaptation and underprotect short bursts, yielding very low hits on multiple traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name arc_adaptive_p_decay_delayed_promotion - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid ARC Segmented LRU with Damped Adaptation**
- **Implementation**: ARC-inspired two-tier cache (A1 probation, Am protected) using per-key LRU timestamps with a light frequency tie-breaker and bounded ghost histories (A1/Am) to steer an adaptive A1 target (p). It applies step-limited target updates on ghost hits, delayed promotion via short-window double-hit, scan clamping via a cold-streak heuristic, periodic decay of p, and LRU-within-segment eviction.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.22 across 48 traces; hit rates span 0.0000–0.8780 with strong results on reuse-heavy traces (e.g., 0.8780, 0.7696, 0.7228, 0.6136) but many low results on scan/one-hit or highly diverse workloads (often ≤0.06).
- **Feedback**: Ghost-guided adaptation and delayed promotion successfully protect reused items, but adaptation can be slow or too conservative under heavy scans/low-locality traces, yielding many near-zero hit rates. Consider more aggressive/dynamic decay, tighter promotion windows, or stronger scan bias when ghost signals are quiet to improve robustness on streaming and long-tail patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name arc_srlu_delayed_promo_decay_scanclamp - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Replacement Cache with Ghost Lists**
- **Implementation**: ARC-like eviction choosing LRU from T1 or T2 based on adaptive p and ghost membership, implemented with OrderedDicts (T1/T2 resident, B1/B2 ghost) and timestamp tie-breaks. Hits promote to T2; inserts adjust p on B1/B2 hits; evicted items move to ghosts; metadata resyncs to cache and ghosts are trimmed to capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.25 over 48 traces; hit rates ranged from 0.0 to 0.8915 with a few strong workloads and many modest/low results.
- **Feedback**: Limited ghost history (ghosts capped at capacity vs. standard 2C) and deferred p-adjustment may weaken adaptation, especially on sequential/adversarial traces. Implementing full ARC REPLACE behavior and 2C ghost sizing could improve stability and hit rates.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 13 - Patch Name arc_pure_plus_resync - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive ARC with delayed promotion**
- **Implementation**: Implements an ARC-style cache with T1/T2 residents and B1/B2 ghosts controlled by adaptive parameter p using OrderedDict LRU. Adds delayed promotion via a window W and pending hits, prefers evicting non-pending T1 items, decays p when idle/cold-streaks, trims ghosts, resynchronizes metadata, and falls back to timestamps.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces; strong on locality-rich traces (0.85–0.89) but very low on scans/anti-locality sequences (many <0.1, one 0.0).
- **Feedback**: Delayed promotion reduces pollution but can miss spaced repetitions; p adapts mainly on ghost hits and decays slowly, underreacting to long scans despite the cold-streak clamp. Consider more aggressive scan detection or faster p decay and tuning W to better handle streams without harming frequent reuse.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name darc_delayed_promo_scanclamp - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Hybrid ARC/SLRU/LRFU Cache**
- **Implementation**: Maintains A1 (probationary) and Am (protected) segments with an ARC-like adaptive A1 target driven by ghost histories (B1/B2), cold-streak damping, and time-based decay. Evictions are chosen via an LRFU-like score within the selected segment; promotions require two hits within a capacity-scaled window, and ghost lists are trimmed to max(2×cap, 256).
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.22 across 48 traces; hit rates ranged 0.0000–0.8860, excelling on locality-rich traces and struggling on scan/low-reuse workloads.
- **Feedback**: The LRFU scoring plus delayed promotion effectively protects true hot items, yielding strong results on repeated-access patterns. However, the large ghost minimum and scan clamping can mis-tune the A1 target on streaming traces, producing very low hit rates; consider reducing ghost bounds toward O(cap) and retuning decay/promotion thresholds.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name arc_slru_lrfu_hybrid_v2 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC-based adaptive cache with delayed promotion**
- **Implementation**: Implements an ARC-like policy with T1/T2 resident lists and B1/B2 ghosts, adaptive target p, and LRU-based eviction chosen between T1/T2 based on p and B2 presence, with timestamp fallback. Adds delayed T1→T2 promotion via a pending window, ghost-hit-driven p adjustment, idle decay, cold-streak clamp, metadata resync, and ghosts trimmed to 2x capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces; strong on several looping/reuse traces (peaks ~0.89) but near-zero on many scan/one-timer workloads.
- **Feedback**: Cold-streak and idle-decay both reduce p (despite comments saying “recency”), biasing toward frequency and likely hurting scan resistance; delayed promotion can miss short bursts, reducing mid-frequency hits. Ghost history supports quick adaptation when patterns repeat, explaining the strong results on repetitive traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 16 - Patch Name arc_delayed_promotion_damped_p_and_ghost_buffer - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with delayed promotion and idle decay**
- **Implementation**: Uses ARC with OrderedDict T1/T2 and ghost lists B1/B2, with adaptive target p tuned by ghost hits, idle-time decay, and a scan clamp. Employs delayed T1 promotion via a pending window, metadata resync, and timestamp-based LRU fallback for tie-breaking.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24; peaks on strong locality traces (up to 0.8888) but many workloads exhibit low hit rates, including several near-zero.
- **Feedback**: Adaptation benefits frequent/recent reuse, but delayed promotion and conservative p decay likely underreact to short bursts and scans, hurting highly non-repetitive workloads. Consider faster T1→T2 promotion and more aggressive p decay during prolonged cold streaks or sequential access patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 17 - Patch Name arc_delayed_promotion_decay_ghost2x - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive SLRU with ARC-style ghosts**
- **Implementation**: Two-segment SLRU (probationary/protected) using per-key access timestamps; promotes on hits and demotes to enforce an adaptive protected target. ARC-style ghost histories (B1/B2) adjust the protected size (±cap//8) and admit ghost hits directly to protected; eviction prefers probationary LRU with protected/global LRU fallbacks, and ghosts are trimmed to ≤2× capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.21 over 48 traces; hit rates ranged 0.0000–0.8680, strong on locality-heavy traces and weak on scan/random-heavy ones.
- **Feedback**: The SLRU+ghost adaptation shields reused items and rebalances segment sizes effectively, yielding high hits on recurring patterns. Low-reuse traces limit gains; consider tuning the initial protected ratio/step size or enhancing scan-resistance in admission.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 18 - Patch Name arc_slru_ghost_adapt - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARCPlus: Adaptive ARC with scan guard**
- **Implementation**: Implements ARC with T1/T2 resident lists and B1/B2 ghost lists via OrderedDict LRU; adapts T1 target p using ghost hits with capped steps, idle-time decay, and a cold-streak scan clamp. Includes resync to cache contents, timestamp tie-breakers, and ghost trimming capped at 2× capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 over 48 traces; hit rates ranged from 0.0 to 0.8934, strong on locality-heavy traces (e.g., 27/28) but weak on many sparse/scan patterns.
- **Feedback**: Aggressive promotion to T2 on any hit and a fallback victim path that can bypass ARC’s T1/T2 preference may bias toward frequency and trigger frequent resyncs, reducing robustness under scans/churn. Tightening eviction to strictly follow T1/T2 LRU and tuning p-decay/scan clamp thresholds could curb near-zero cases while preserving the high-hit scenarios.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 19 - Patch Name arc_plus_simplified - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC-based adaptive cache eviction**
- **Implementation**: Implements Adaptive Replacement Cache using OrderedDicts for T1/T2/B1/B2 with adjustable target p and the ARC REPLACE rule. Adds metadata resync with the real cache, proportional ghost trimming (|B1|≈p, |B2|≈C−p), step-capped p updates, and a timestamp-LRU fallback.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces, with hit rates spanning 0.0000–0.8925.
- **Feedback**: Adapts well on locality-rich/repetitive traces (peaks ~0.85–0.89) but underperforms on low-locality or scan-like workloads (several near-zero traces). The conservative, step-capped p adjustments and cautious ghost trimming may slow responsiveness to phase shifts; faster adaptation or scan detection could improve the weak cases.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 20 - Patch Name arc_strict_p_proportional - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARCPlus adaptive cache with ghost tuning**
- **Implementation**: ARC variant with OrderedDict-based T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) lists, adaptive target p, proportional ghost trimming, idle p-decay, and a scan clamp via cold_streak. Includes metadata resync safeguards and a ghost-informed fallback victim policy with timestamp tie-breaking.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces; hit rates spanned 0.00–0.89, performing strongly on reuse-heavy traces (~0.86–0.89) and weakly on scan-like/sparse workloads.
- **Feedback**: Adaptive p updates and ghost-aware replacement help on mixed/frequent reuse, but aggressive probation and conservative decay leave gaps on long scans or low locality. Resync and B1/B2 balancing improve robustness, yet high variance suggests the need for stronger scan resistance or more dynamic p adjustment.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 21 - Patch Name arc_ghost_proportional_and_invariant_fixes - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Replacement Cache with Ghosts and LRU Fallback**
- **Implementation**: Implements ARC using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) with ARC’s REPLACE rule, adaptive target p updates bounded by step_cap (≤ C/8), and ghost trimming capped at 2C biased by p. Metadata is continuously resynced with the real cache, can be rebuilt from timestamps, and falls back to a global LRU tie-breaker when needed.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.23; across 48 traces, hit rates ranged from 0.0000 to 0.8874 with several high-locality traces performing strongly (~0.70–0.89).
- **Feedback**: The bounded p adjustments stabilize behavior but slow adaptation to rapid phase changes, contributing to weak performance on scan/low-locality traces (many near-zero hit rates). Frequent resync/rebuild maintains correctness and recoverability, while p-biased ghost trimming prevents ghost explosion but can shorten useful history under churn.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 22 - Patch Name arc_resiliency_improvements - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC-like Cache with Adaptive p and Ghosts**
- **Implementation**: Maintains ARC-style T1/T2 resident sets with per-key LRU timestamps and B1/B2 ghost histories. Eviction follows ARC REPLACE; p adapts on ghost hits with a damped step and scan controls (cold-streak clamp and periodic decay), uses immediate T1→T2 promotion on hits, and keeps ghosts disjoint and pruned to ≤2× capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score = 0.24; hit rates vary widely (0.00–0.89) across 48 traces with several mid-0.5 results and many near-zero cases.
- **Feedback**: Strong on locality-heavy/repeating workloads (e.g., traces 27/28/34/38) but weak on scans and low-reuse sequences (e.g., 11, 14–19), indicating slow recovery and over-protection of T2. More aggressive scan handling (faster p decrease) or delayed promotion could improve worst-case behavior.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 23 - Patch Name arc_promotion_and_strict_replace - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARCPlus adaptive cache with ghost lists**
- **Implementation**: ARC variant using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) with proportional ghost trimming (≤2C), damped p-adjustment on ghost hits, ARC-style victim choice, unconditional hit promotion to T2, ghost-informed fallback (prefer B1, then not-in-B2, then timestamp), and periodic metadata resync. A p-decay mechanism is defined but never invoked.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces; hit rates range from 0.0 to 0.8925 with solid mid-to-high results on locality-rich traces and many low (<0.1) outcomes on others.
- **Feedback**: Damped p updates and aggressive T2 promotion aid reuse-heavy workloads, but the unused p-decay limits recovery after scans, likely leaving p in suboptimal states. Invoking idle decay and/or tightening probationary admission could improve robustness on scan-heavy or bursty traces; aligning fallback closer to ARC when metadata diverges may further stabilize performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 24 - Patch Name arc_simplify_strict_and_gentle_p - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC-based adaptive cache with ghosts and fallback timestamp**
- **Implementation**: Implements an ARC variant using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) with arc_p-guided replacement (evict from T1 vs T2), immediate promotion on hits, and ghost-hit-driven p adjustments on insert. Includes metadata resync with the real cache, trims ghosts to 2× capacity, and falls back to LRU timestamps when resident lists are empty.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces; hit rates ranged from 0.0000 to 0.8925, with several mid-high (~0.5–0.89) but many low (≤0.1).
- **Feedback**: Strong on locality-rich workloads but struggles on streaming/low-locality traces, yielding mixed results. A defined p-decay mechanism is never invoked and some delayed-promotion state is unused, potentially limiting adaptation and suggesting opportunities for cleanup and tuning.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 25 - Patch Name arc_canonical_stabilize - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive Replacement Cache with Ghosts**
- **Implementation**: ARC-style eviction using OrderedDict-backed T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) lists, with adaptive split parameter p bounded to capacity and ghosts trimmed to 2× capacity targeting |B1|≈p and |B2|≈C−p. Hits promote to T2 MRU; inserts consult ghosts to adjust p with bounded steps; evictions move residents to corresponding ghosts, with timestamp tie-breaker fallback and periodic resync to the actual cache.
- **Performance**: Combined score to maximize: 0.24 across 48 traces; hit rates span 0.0000–0.8925 with strong results on locality-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: The adaptive recency/frequency balance works well when reuse exists, but aggressive T2 promotion and conservative p adjustments likely hurt scan-resistance and slow adaptation, leading to many low-hit traces. Resynchronization and ghost-size targeting add stability but may bias T1 when metadata drifts.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 26 - Patch Name arc_refine_p_ghosts_disjoint - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARCPlus: Adaptive ARC with ghost-driven tuning**
- **Implementation**: Uses OrderedDicts for ARC lists (T1/T2 and ghost B1/B2), adaptively tunes target p via ghost hits with damped steps, idle decay, and a scan-clamp; includes proportional ghost trimming, ghost-aware victim selection with timestamp tie-breakers, and resync guards to keep metadata consistent.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces, with hit rates ranging from 0.00 to 0.89 (strong on several high-locality traces, weak on many scan-like workloads).
- **Feedback**: Ghost-informed adaptation and scan/idle safeguards produce solid results on repetitive/frequent patterns, but numerous very low hit rates indicate p-adaptation and immediate T2 promotions can still mis-handle cold streams or shifting locality. Consistency/resync logic preserves correctness, though behavior suggests tuning sensitivity and global-state dynamics may hinder stable performance across diverse traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 27 - Patch Name arc_p_decay_and_scan_clamp - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with adaptive p and ghost trimming**
- **Implementation**: Implements ARC using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 (residents) and B1/B2 (ghosts), with MRU updates and LRU eviction; maintains an adaptive target p (initialized at ~0.5C) updated on ghost hits with step-capped, ratio-based adjustments. Includes robust resync to actual cache state and keeps ghosts disjoint and bounded (≤2C) via proportional trimming toward |B1|≈p and |B2|≈C−p.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 over 48 traces; strong on locality-heavy workloads (peaks up to 0.8906) but weak on scan-like/adversarial traces (several near 0).
- **Feedback**: The step-capped adaptation and half-capacity p initialization can slow responsiveness, and promoting unknown hits directly to T2 may overfavor frequency, hurting recency-sensitive/scan workloads. Proportional ghost trimming (vs. canonical ARC’s precise replace dynamics) may further reduce adaptation sharpness, contributing to uneven performance.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 28 - Patch Name arc_resync_proportional_ghosts_strict_replace - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: LRU-2 with CRP history**
- **Implementation**: Implements LRU-K (K=2) with a correlated reference period (CRP), maintaining per-key (last_ts, prev_ts) and only promoting distinct references when spaced by a CRP window derived from capacity (cap//16); histories persist across evictions and are pruned to ~16x capacity. Eviction selects the key maximizing (is_cold, now−prev, now−last), prioritizing cold items, then largest backward 2-distance, then older last reference.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 over 48 traces; hit rates range 0.0000–0.8942 with strong results on traces 27/28/34/38 and weak/near-zero on several others.
- **Feedback**: Effectively filters one-hit wonders and favors proven reuse, boosting recurring workloads; it struggles on scans or sparse-reuse traces where few items get a second distinct reference. The CRP window tied to capacity may be mis-sized for some workloads; tuning CRP or admission could improve stability on low-hit traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 29 - Patch Name lruk2_crp - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC+aged-LFU with proportional ghosts**
- **Implementation**: ARC variant with T1/T2 resident sets and B1/B2 ghosts (bounded to 2×capacity) maintaining strict disjointness/invariants via resync. Eviction uses ARC REPLACE to choose T1 LRU or T2 victim by aged-LFU (freq with time-decay), with p adjusted asymmetrically on B1/B2 hits and proportional ghost trimming around p.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23 across 48 traces; hit rates span 0.0000–0.8451 with strong results on locality-heavy traces (e.g., 27/28/34/38) and many low/near-zero cases.
- **Feedback**: Proportional ghost control and C/8-bounded p updates stabilize behavior but can under-adapt to abrupt phase changes, explaining poor streaming/scan traces (e.g., 14, 32). Aged-LFU in T2 effectively protects frequent items when locality exists, while strict resync/ghost disjointness safeguards correctness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 30 - Patch Name arc_lfu_plus - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive ARC with Ghost History**
- **Implementation**: ARC-style eviction using OrderedDict-backed T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) lists with adaptive target p and an idle-decay heuristic; eviction picks LRU from T1 or T2 based on p, with timestamp fallback, and metadata resync plus ghost trimming keep structures bounded and consistent. Hits promote to T2 MRU; inserts adjust p on ghost hits and place new items in T1.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.25 over 48 traces, with hit rates ranging 0.0000–0.8922 (notably strong on traces 27, 28, 34, 38 but weak on many others).
- **Feedback**: The ghost-guided p adaptation and scan-recovery help when locality exists, but reliance on resync/timestamp fallback and omission of a full ARC replacement routine likely reduced robustness on scan-heavy or long-tail workloads. Balancing between T1/T2 at eviction time could improve consistency across diverse traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 31 - Patch Name arc_hybrid_decay - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with LFU sampling and aging**
- **Implementation**: Combines Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC: T1/T2 with B1/B2 ghosts and adaptive p) with LFU-based victim choice by sampling the k oldest entries and evicting the lowest-frequency item; frequencies are aged by periodic halving, with timestamp fallback, ghost trimming, and metadata resync. p is adjusted on ghost hits with bounded steps to prevent overshoot.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces; mid-range hits (~0.44–0.54) on several, very high on a few (up to 0.8927), but many traces are low (near 0–0.1).
- **Feedback**: The ARC+LFU blend helps on mixed recency/frequency and repeated working sets, but struggles on short or rapidly shifting/scan-like traces—likely due to slow aging (min 1000 accesses) and limited sampling (k ≤ 8). Tuning AGE_INTERVAL_FACTOR, increasing/adapting sample_k, and adhering more closely to ARC’s replace policy could reduce worst-case drops.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 32 - Patch Name arc_lfu_sample_protected - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC+LFU Hybrid Cache Eviction**
- **Implementation**: Implements Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) with T1/T2 resident lists, B1/B2 ghost lists, and adaptive target p, augmented by lightweight LFU counters with periodic aging and timestamp tie-breaks. Eviction samples among the k oldest entries of the chosen list (min(16, max(2, C/8))) selecting the lowest-frequency key; metadata resync and ghost trimming keep structures consistent and bounded.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.25 over 48 traces, with hit rates ranging from 0.0 to 0.8927 (strong peaks on traces 27–28, but many traces below 0.1).
- **Feedback**: The ARC core plus LFU-sampled eviction improves results on mixed recency/frequency workloads with stable reuse, reflected in high-hit traces. However, conservative p-adjustment and slow frequency aging reduce responsiveness, leading to collapses on scan/phase-shift workloads; automatic resync that seeds missing keys into T1 may further bias eviction under drift.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 33 - Patch Name arc_lfu_tuning_and_selective_freq - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive ARC with Delayed Promotion**
- **Implementation**: Implements an ARC variant using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 and ghost lists (B1/B2), adaptive p updates bounded by step caps, delayed promotion from T1 to T2 via a short pending window, ghost-list trimming to 2x capacity proportional to p, periodic p decay when idle, and a cold-streak clamp that biases toward recency. Metadata is resynced with the cache snapshot and kept disjoint across resident and ghost lists.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces, with per-trace hit rates ranging from 0.0 to 0.885 (strong on several locality-rich traces but weak on many others).
- **Feedback**: The delayed promotion and conservative p adjustments help avoid over-promoting bursts, yielding strong results on frequency/recency mixed workloads, but many traces show low hit rates, suggesting under-promotion of moderately hot items and insufficient scan resistance. The idle decay and cold-streak clamp mitigate scans somewhat but may still leave T1/T2 mis-sized for highly dynamic or adversarial patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 34 - Patch Name arc_strict_replace_proportional_ghosts - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with idle decay and ghost-aware adaptation**
- **Implementation**: Implements Adaptive Replacement Cache with OrderedDict-backed T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) lists, adjusting arc_p on B1/B2 ghost hits, decaying p when idle, clamping on cold streaks, trimming ghosts to 2x capacity, and using timestamp LRU as a fallback. Hits promote to T2; eviction follows ARC’s T1 vs T2 choice with periodic resync to actual cache contents.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces, strong on reuse-heavy traces (up to 0.8925) but weak on scan-like patterns (as low as 0.0000).
- **Feedback**: ARC core is implemented coherently, and extra controls (idle decay, cold-streak clamp) aim to mitigate scans but still underperform on several traces, suggesting adaptation may be too slow or promotions too aggressive. Unused/rarely used state (e.g., t1_pending) indicates some complexity without clear benefit.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 35 - Patch Name arc_p_decay_and_cold_scan_clamp - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with adaptive ghosts and idle decay**
- **Implementation**: Implements an ARC-based policy using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghosts), with dynamic p updated on ghost hits, idle-time decay toward recency, and a cold-streak scan clamp. Eviction follows ARC’s T1/T2 choice with LRU ordering and a timestamped fallback; ghosts are trimmed to 2×capacity proportionally to p, and a resync step keeps metadata aligned with the cache.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.25 over 48 traces, with strong hit rates on several reuse-heavy traces (up to 0.8908) but many low-hit traces.
- **Feedback**: Adaptive p and ghost learning benefit frequent/mixed workloads, while scan clamp and idle decay add some scan resilience but still struggle on streaming or tiny-reuse patterns; the program passes all validation tests. Minor drift (necessitating resync) and unused metadata (e.g., t1_pending) suggest opportunities to refine promotion timing and scan detection.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 36 - Patch Name arc_pure_promotion_and_gentler_cold_bias - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with LFU-aged Sampling Eviction**
- **Implementation**: Implements ARC with T1/T2 resident lists and B1/B2 ghost lists using OrderedDicts, adapting arc_p via ratio-based, step-capped adjustments. Eviction samples the k oldest in T1/T2 and chooses the lowest LFU (with periodic halving) and timestamp tie-breaks, includes cross-list overrides, ghost trimming to 2×capacity, and periodic metadata resync.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 across 48 traces; strong on traces 27/28/34/38 (0.63–0.89) but many low-locality traces are ≤0.12, including one at 0.0.
- **Feedback**: LFU-aware sampling improves frequent-reuse workloads but can over-retain stale items under scans/churn, hurting scan-heavy traces. Faster frequency aging or a fallback to pure ARC when ghost signals indicate scanning could improve robustness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 37 - Patch Name arc_lfu_crosslist_selection - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC-based adaptive cache eviction**
- **Implementation**: Implements an ARC variant using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost), evicting the LRU of the chosen list based on the ARC replacement rule with ghost-aware and timestamp fallbacks. arc_p is adaptively tuned with bounded step sizes, ghosts are trimmed to capacity, metadata is resynced with the cache on drift, and an idle-driven decay of p aims to improve scan resistance.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.25 over 48 traces; strong on locality-rich traces (e.g., 0.86–0.89 on 27–28, 0.75 on 34) but many traces show very low hit rates (<0.1, including one at 0.0).
- **Feedback**: ARC mechanics and ghost-informed fallbacks work well for mixed recency/frequency workloads, but scan-heavy or adversarial patterns still degrade performance, suggesting idle decay and conservative arc_p adjustments are too mild. Consider more aggressive p adaptation on B1/B2 hits and improved handling of one-time scans/cyclic patterns to reduce thrashing.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 38 - Patch Name arc_strict_replace_bounded_p_and_ghost_fallback - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive ARC with Ghost Decay Clamp**
- **Implementation**: Implements Adaptive Replacement Cache using OrderedDict-backed T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) lists, with eviction chosen between T1 and T2 based on arc_p and B2 membership. arc_p adapts via ghost hits with bounded steps, decays when idle, and a streaming-aware cold_streak clamp biases to recency; ghosts are trimmed to 2× capacity and metadata is resynced defensively.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.25; per-trace hit rates ranged from 0.0 to 0.8908, strong on repetitive/looping traces (27, 28, 34, 38) but weak on streaming/one-hit patterns.
- **Feedback**: The adaptive arc_p and ghost-feedback effectively capture frequency, yet several near-zero traces indicate scan detection/recency bias is still insufficient under heavy streaming. t1_pending and timestamps are maintained but largely unused for decisions, suggesting missed signals despite robust resync and ghost trimming ensuring correctness.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 39 - Patch Name arc_stream_clamp_and_strict_replace - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC variant with LFU and scan clamp**
- **Implementation**: Simplified ARC with resident T1/T2 and ghost B1/B2, adaptive target p adjusted by ghost hits and a cold-streak scan clamp; eviction chooses a segment via ARC REPLACE then picks a victim by LFU-with-decay then LRU. Includes a lightweight frequency sketch with periodic halving, timestamped recency, and ghost pruning to 2×capacity while keeping ghosts disjoint from residents.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 over 48 traces, with hit rates spanning 0.00–0.89 (strong on repetitive/locality-heavy traces, many low scores on others).
- **Feedback**: The LFU-LRU hybrid within ARC helps repeated/bursty reuse, but immediate promotion and cautious p adjustments under cold streaks appear to over-protect, hurting scans and rapidly shifting workloads. Consider true delayed promotion, more aggressive p retreat during cold phases, or tuning decay/ghost sizing to improve scan resistance and adaptability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 40 - Patch Name arc_hybrid_lfu_scanaware - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC+ with Ghost Hints and Scan-Awareness**
- **Implementation**: ARC-derived design with resident T1/T2 and ghost B1/B2, an adaptive target p (idle decay, scan clamps), ghost-biased ghost pruning, and ghost-hinted victim selection prioritized by ghost rank, then a decaying frequency sketch, then timestamps. Hits promote to T2; cold streaks trigger probationary inserts (forced LRU) and optional T2→T1 demotion.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23 across 48 traces, with hit rates ranging 0.0000–0.8934 (strong on locality-heavy traces like 27/28/34/38, weak on scan/uniform workloads).
- **Feedback**: Ghost-aware picking and adaptive p improved re-reference capture and balanced recency/frequency; the decaying frequency sketch stabilized tie-breaking. However, aggressive scan clamps and demotions can shrink T1 excessively and over-evict under long scans or highly diverse accesses, causing near-zero hit rates on several traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 41 - Patch Name arc_plus_scanaware_ghosthint - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive ARC with LFU-LRU and scan defense**
- **Implementation**: Implements a simplified ARC with resident T1/T2 and ghost B1/B2 sets, adapting target p via ghost hits plus a cold-streak scan clamp. Eviction uses hybrid LFU-LRU with a decaying frequency sketch, two-hit delayed promotion to T2, periodic demotion of weak T2 under scans, and ghost lists pruned to 2×capacity.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24; hit rates span from near 0 to 0.89, excelling on skewed/repetitive traces (e.g., 0.8352, 0.8900, 0.7246, 0.6347) but weak on scan/large-working-set traces.
- **Feedback**: Frequency-aware eviction and ghost-driven p adaptation work well on locality-rich workloads, but heavy streams and large working sets defeat protections despite scan clamps. Consider tuning p step sizes, promotion window, and demotion thresholds to reduce over-demotion and improve responsiveness during scans.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 42 - Patch Name arc_two_hit_promotion_and_scan_demote - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with scan-aware ghost tuning**
- **Implementation**: ARC variant using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghosts), adapting arc_p via ghost hits with capped step sizes, scan detection (cold_streak) that inserts at LRU, and idle p decay; metadata is resynced to cache contents, ghosts are trimmed to capacity, and a timestamp map is used for tie-breaking. Eviction selects LRU from T1 or T2 per arc_p, with ghost- and timestamp-informed fallbacks.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.25 across 48 traces, with strong hit rates on reuse-heavy traces (e.g., 27=0.858, 28=0.892, 34=0.767, 38=0.640) but many low-hit cases (e.g., 14=0.000, 15–19≈0.02).
- **Feedback**: Scan-aware probation and capped p adjustments help frequent/reuse workloads, but constrained ghost history (B1+B2 capped at capacity) and aggressive p decay during cold streaks likely hurt scans/large working sets, producing many near-zero traces. Consider allowing larger ghost history (toward 2×capacity), softening p decay, and tuning stream thresholds to reduce overreaction.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 43 - Patch Name arc_scan_aware_ghost_bias - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with scan-aware adaptive recency/frequency**
- **Implementation**: Implements ARC using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 and ghost lists B1/B2, with online p adaptation driven by ghost hits. Adds scan-aware features: idle p decay, cold-streak detection that inserts at T1 LRU and demotes T2 LRUs, plus a ghost-informed eviction fallback; ghost lists are capacity-bounded and metadata is kept disjoint.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24; strong on locality-heavy traces (e.g., 0.86–0.89 on 27–28, 0.77 on 34, 0.64 on 38) but poor/near-zero on many streaming/sparse traces (e.g., 13–19, 14=0.00).
- **Feedback**: ARC core is correct and adaptive, and scan defenses help in places, but many traces still degrade to low hit rates. Tuning p update caps and the cold-streak demotion/probation policy (and possibly tempering aggressive promotion to T2) could improve robustness under scans without sacrificing frequent-item protection.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 44 - Patch Name arc_scan_aware_p_adapt - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Scan-Guarded SLRU with TinyLFU and Ghost Tuning**
- **Implementation**: SLRU with window/probation/protected segments and ghost sets (Gp/Gq) adapt the window size; TinyLFU-like decaying counts inform a hybrid victim choice (lowest frequency then LRU), with scan-guarded insertions and direct protection on ghost hits. Idle drift recenters the window target toward a baseline when ghost activity is quiet, and ghosts are pruned to 2×capacity with side bias.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.25 across 48 traces; hit rates ranged 0.0–0.8886, strong on locality-heavy traces (e.g., 27–28, 34, 38) and weak on scan/no-reuse workloads.
- **Feedback**: Ghost-driven window tuning and TinyLFU preserved frequent items, delivering high peaks, but scan-guard thresholds and direct-to-protected on ghost hits can overprotect Q and under-serve recency during streams, causing collapses on purely cold workloads. More aggressive scan detection or faster window shrink could improve robustness on streaming traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name s3q_scan_guard_slru - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive ARC with delayed promotion**
- **Implementation**: Implements an ARC-style cache with T1/T2 resident lists and B1/B2 ghosts, adaptive target p, ghost trimming, and biased LRU victim selection; adds delayed T1→T2 promotion via a pending window, idle/ghost-hit-based p updates, and a cold-streak “streaming clamp” that demotes some T2 items to T1.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23 across 48 traces with wide variance (per-trace hit rates range from 0.00 to 0.87).
- **Feedback**: Strong on workloads with clear reuse/frequency signals, but many traces underperform, likely due to inverted p adjustments on idle/streaming (decreasing p favors frequency, contrary to the intended “recency” bias) and a tight promotion window that under-recognizes moderate reuse. These heuristics can over-penalize recency during scans and cause oscillation, explaining the mixed results.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 46 - Patch Name arc_scan_aware_bias_and_adaptive_p - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with scan-aware adaptations**
- **Implementation**: Implements an ARC variant with T1/T2 resident sets and B1/B2 ghost lists, adaptive target p, idle-based decay, and scan detection via a cold_streak that inserts at LRU and demotes T2 during scans. Eviction selects T1/T2 LRU based on p and ghost hints (with early T1 bias under scans), trims ghosts to 2×capacity, resyncs metadata with the cache, and uses timestamp tie-breakers.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.24 over 48 traces; hit rates ranged 0.0000–0.8934 with strong results on locality-heavy traces and collapses on several others.
- **Feedback**: Scan handling and p-capping help avoid frequency lock-in, but aggressive cold_streak thresholds and demotions can cause T1/T2 churn, yielding very low hit rates on some patterns. Retuning p adjustments and scan thresholds could smooth the sharp drops while preserving the high peaks.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 47 - Patch Name arc_scan_aware_ghost_proportional - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC-S3: Scan-guarded ARC with TinyLFU**
- **Implementation**: Implements an ARC variant using OrderedDicts for T1/T2 residents and B1/B2 ghosts, with adaptive target p updated via ghost hits (asymmetric caps, ceiling ratios) and idle drift toward a baseline. Eviction follows ARC REPLACE, then picks within-segment victims from an LRU-side window using a decaying TinyLFU score with timestamp tie-breaks; includes scan defense (LRU insertion plus limited T2 demotion), ghost-aware resynchronization, and bounded ghost trimming.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.22 over 48 traces (passes validation), with hit rates from 0.0000 to 0.8831 and strong results on traces 27, 28, 34, and 38.
- **Feedback**: The scan guard and TinyLFU windowing help on repetitive/skewed workloads, but many traces show very low hit rates, suggesting T2 demotion and p drift may overreact and sacrifice short-term recency. Tuning decay period, demotion amount, victim window size, and ghost limits could improve stability on churny or low-locality workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 48 - Patch Name arc_s3_scan_guarded_tinylfu - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC-based adaptive cache with scan and ghost bias**
- **Implementation**: Implements ARC with OrderedDict-backed T1/T2 (resident) and B1/B2 (ghost) lists, adaptive target p, and eviction choosing LRU from T1 or T2 based on p and B2 membership. Adds scan-aware probationary insertion and T2-to-T1 demotion, idle-time p decay, proportional ghost trimming with a short bias window, and robust resync that seeds residents from ghost hints.
- **Performance**: Combined score 0.23 across 48 traces, ranging from strong locality cases (up to 0.8874) to poor streaming-like cases (down to 0.0000).
- **Feedback**: The adaptive p updates, ghost-bias trimming, and scan-aware handling boost performance on multi-phase and frequent-reuse workloads, reflected in top decile traces. However, long runs of novel keys still degrade hit rates despite cold-streak handling, suggesting further tuning of stream detection or more aggressive bypass/clamping during heavy diversity.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 49 - Patch Name arc_scanaware_plus - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- Strict ARC REPLACE with proactive resync lifted the floor and stabilized eviction. The current best program (Combined 0.25) implements canonical REPLACE (evict from T1 when |T1| > p or obj ∈ B2 and |T1| == p; else from T2) and always resyncs T1/T2 to the live cache before choosing. This mirrors other 0.25 performers such as “ARC with scan-aware ghost tuning” (Gen 43, 0.25) and contrasts with fallback-heavy designs that underperform on scans.
- Immediate promotion to T2 on hits preserved bursts and delivered consistent high peaks. The current best promotes any hit to T2 MRU, matching prior 0.25 clusters where traces 27/28/34/38 scored ≈0.64–0.89. Its per-trace results show 27=0.858, 28=0.8922, 34=0.7670, 38=0.6404.
- Asymmetric, ghost-driven p updates with bounded steps improved adaptation. The best program uses ratio-based increases on B1 hits and capped decreases on B2 hits, plus idle decay and a scan clamp that inserts at T1 LRU and nudges p down. Similar ghost-driven policies feature in 0.24–0.25 ARC variants (Gen 40/42/43/44/47).
- Metadata hygiene (disjoint resident/ghost sets, bounded ghosts, periodic resync) correlated with stable mid-tier performance. The best program enforces disjointness, trims ghosts (capacity-bounded here), and seeds unknown residents from ghost hints during resync—patterns echoed in 0.25 peers.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Heavy LFU blending or slow aging reduced scan responsiveness and hurt averages. “ARC-S3: Scan-guarded ARC with TinyLFU” (Gen 48, 0.22) reports very low hit rates on many traces, with feedback citing overreactive T2 demotion and p drift sacrificing short-term recency. Earlier LFU hybrids (Gen 40/42 at 0.24) similarly note weak scan resistance.
- Over-aggressive scan clamps and demotions shrank T1 and caused churn. “ARC+ with Ghost Hints and Scan-Awareness” (Gen 41, 0.23) and “ARC with scan-aware adaptations” (Gen 47, 0.24) both attribute several near-zero traces to aggressive cold_streak thresholds and T2 demotions that over-evict during long scans or diverse accesses.
- Delayed promotion or inverted p bias penalized recency and under-recognized reuse. “Adaptive ARC with delayed promotion” (Gen 46, 0.23) reports inverted idle/streaming p moves (decreasing p favors frequency) and a tight promotion window; “Adaptive ARC with LFU-LRU and scan defense” (Gen 42, 0.24) notes two-hit promotion and demotion thresholds that reduce responsiveness.
- Overly tight ghost history sometimes correlates with scan collapses. “ARC with scan-aware ghost tuning” (Gen 43, 0.25) caps B1+B2 at capacity and still scores well, but feedback links constrained ghosts and aggressive p decay to near-zero scan traces—consistent with observed lows on streaming/sparse patterns across the set.

## Implementation Insights
- Deterministic REPLACE path with minimal fallbacks reduces drift-induced errors. The current best chooses LRU from T1/T2 per p (and obj ∈ B2) and only falls back to ghost/timestamp hints if one list is empty—unlike non-strict designs that lean on global timestamps and see lower robustness on scan-like traces.
- Resync that seeds residents from ghosts maintains metadata fidelity. The best program’s _resync() prunes missing residents, seeds unknown cached keys into T1/T2 using B1/B2 hints, and enforces disjointness. This keeps ARC decisions aligned with reality and is repeatedly cited as a stabilizer in 0.25 variants.
- Simple, targeted scan defense avoids overfitting: LRU probation during cold streaks and mild p decay. The best program increments cold_streak on brand-new inserts, inserts at T1 LRU when cold_streak ≥ C/2, and reduces p by C/8, providing scan resistance without heavy demotions. In contrast, Gen 41/47’s more aggressive demotions induce churn and collapse.
- Lightweight tie-breakers and bounded metadata prevent pathological growth. Using OrderedDict for O(1) MRU/LRU, removing timestamps on eviction, and trimming ghosts each call keep overhead predictable while preserving performance (seen in current best and several 0.24–0.25 programs).

## Performance Analysis
- The current best program achieves a 0.25 combined score with a solid floor on traces 1–10 (~0.44–0.54) and strong peaks on locality-heavy traces (27/28/34/38 ≈ 0.64–0.89). Its weaknesses are the same as the cohort’s: near-zero on scan/uniform traces (e.g., 14=0.000, 15–19≈0.02).
- Programs adhering closely to canonical ARC with immediate promotion and resync cluster at 0.24–0.25 (Gen 40/42/43/44/47/49), whereas deviations—delayed promotion (Gen 46, 0.23), aggressive demotions (Gen 41, 0.23), or heavier TinyLFU blending (Gen 48, 0.22)—tend to lower the average and exacerbate scan collapses.
- SLRU/TinyLFU hybrids can reach 0.25 (“Scan-Guarded SLRU with TinyLFU,” Gen 45) but share the same failure modes on pure scans (feedback: overprotection of the protected segment and underserving recency), underscoring that the differentiator is mid-tier stability rather than peak reuse performance.
- Across all ARC-based designs, immediate T2 promotion and ghost-driven asymmetric p updates produce consistent high peaks; the average is primarily governed by how strictly REPLACE is implemented and how gently scan defenses adjust structures. The current best exemplifies this balance, matching the top combined score while showing the typical scan weaknesses common to the class.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. Move ghost-driven p updates into evict before REPLACE so the victim choice reflects the newest signal. In evict, if obj.key ∈ B1, do arc_p += min(ceil(|B2|/|B1|), C//8); if ∈ B2, do arc_p -= min(ceil(|B1|/|B2|), C//8 or C//4 when cold_streak ≥ C//2), then run the canonical REPLACE decision. Reset last_ghost_hit_access and cold_streak on these ghost hits, and remove the duplicate p adjustment from update_after_insert to avoid double-stepping. This aligns with canonical ARC and matches what strong 0.24–0.25 variants do to stabilize choices.

2. Add a scan-aware probation + T2 relief path that is gentle but effective. When key ∉ B1∪B2 and cold_streak ≥ C//2, keep inserting at T1 LRU (already present), and additionally demote up to k = min(2, C//16) items from T2 LRU to T1 LRU. Also bias REPLACE toward T1 for a short window scan_guard_until = access_count + C//8 (i.e., choose from T1 unless T1 is empty) and nudge arc_p down by min(C//8, cold_streak // max(1, C//8)). This preserves frequent items in T2 during scans, improving low-trace floors without hurting reuse-heavy peaks, consistent with successful mild scan defenses.

3. Expand and bias ghost history trimming to retain better signal. Increase the ghost budget to |B1| + |B2| ≤ 2*C (canonical ARC) and track arc_last_ghost_hit_side plus a short bias window ghost_bias_until = access_count + C//8. In _trim_ghosts, while over budget, trim the opposite side of the last ghost hit during the bias window; outside the window, trim from the larger side as now. This maintains disjoint, bounded metadata while preserving the most predictive ghost side, a pattern seen in stable 0.24–0.25 clusters.

4. Strengthen fallback victim selection with ordered, ghost-informed picks rather than arbitrary cache scans. If the chosen REPLACE list is empty after a resync, try in order: (a) T1 LRU not in B2, (b) T2 LRU that appears in B1, (c) scan up to C//16 from T1 then T2 LRU->MRU to find a key not in B2, (d) timestamp tie-breaker. This keeps eviction pressure on recency-only or unhinted items and avoids evicting B2-indicated frequent candidates, mirroring the ghost-driven robustness of top performers.

5. Make idle/scan p decay proportional and bounded to speed recovery without oscillation. Replace _decay_p_if_idle with arc_p = max(0, arc_p - min(C//8, max(1, idle // max(1, C//4)))) and, when cold_streak ≥ C//2, additionally apply a one-time clamp arc_p = max(0, arc_p - min(C//4, cold_streak // max(1, C//8))). Reset decay on any ghost hit (as you already track) to avoid unnecessary drift. This preserves the asymmetric, ghost-led adaptation while addressing scan/streaming collapses noted across the cohort.
