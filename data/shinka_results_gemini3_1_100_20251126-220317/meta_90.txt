# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Basic Dictionary-Based Least Recently Used (LRU)**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm tracks the most recent access time (access count) for each object in a global dictionary and evicts the object with the lowest timestamp value.
- **Performance**: It achieves a combined score of 0.21, performing strongly on traces with high temporal locality but poorly on scan-heavy or looping patterns.
- **Feedback**: While the logic correctly implements the standard LRU policy, the O(N) linear scan for the minimum timestamp is inefficient, and the lack of frequency tracking limits hit rates on non-recency-based workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: LFU-DA with Dynamic Aging and LRU Tie-Breaking**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm implements Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging (LFU-DA) by calculating priorities as frequency plus a global aging factor (the priority of the last evicted item), using a linear scan to identify the eviction victim.
- **Performance**: It achieved a combined score of 0.22, demonstrating strong performance on frequency-stable workloads (up to 0.88 hit rate) but failing completely on scan-heavy traces (0.00 hit rate).
- **Feedback**: While the dynamic aging factor effectively prevents cache pollution common in standard LFU, the algorithm lacks specific mechanisms to handle scan patterns and the $O(N)$ eviction search is computationally inefficient.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name lfuda_eviction - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Static S-Queue Allocation and Lazy Promotion**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes two queues (S for new, M for frequent) with a 10% static allocation for S, employing lazy promotion where accessed eviction candidates are moved to M.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.23, showing strong locality handling (hit rates >0.88) but poor performance on specific scan patterns (hit rates ~0.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation correctly separates one-hit wonders, but the fixed 10% S-queue size lacks adaptability for varying workload phases, causing significant drops in hit rate for certain traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name s3fifo_v1 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Segmented LRU with Fixed Protected Capacity**
- **Implementation**: This Segmented LRU (SLRU) implementation uses two `OrderedDict` segments, `probationary` and `protected`, promoting items to `protected` on hits with a fixed cap of 80% capacity. Overflow from `protected` demotes items back to `probationary`, and eviction strictly targets the LRU of the `probationary` segment first.
- **Performance**: It achieved a combined score of 0.23, with high efficiency on select patterns (up to 0.88) but near-zero hit rates on numerous other traces.
- **Feedback**: The rigid 80% protected limit provides scan resistance but likely starves the probationary segment during high churn, suggesting an adaptive partition size would improve consistency across diverse workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name slru_algorithm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: LeCaR with Randomized Policy Selection**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a probability weight to dynamically switch between LRU and LFU eviction, updating the weight via multiplicative updates when re-accessing previously evicted keys tracked in history buffers.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieves a low overall score of 0.21, with hit rates varying drastically from near 0% on many traces to 87% on specific stable workloads.
- **Feedback**: The probabilistic switching mechanism combined with a fixed learning rate appears too unstable for dynamic workloads, often failing to converge on an optimal policy quickly enough.

- **Implementation**: Maintains a small nursery queue (10%) and a main queue (90%) with a ghost cache to rescue frequently evicted items, using a 1-bit clock scheme for promotion and reinsertion.
- **Performance**: Combined score of 0.23, showing strong results on high-locality workloads (up to 88% hit rate) but near-zero performance on several specific traces.
- **Feedback**: The use of ghost caches and the S/M split provides effective scan resistance and frequency tracking, though the static 10% nursery size may lack flexibility for varying working set structures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name s3fifo - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Segmented LRU with Fixed 80% Protected Capacity**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes an ordered dictionary for global LRU tracking and a set to maintain a protected segment (fixed at 80% of cache) where items are promoted upon hits and the segment's LRU is demoted when full.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.23, performing well on stable frequency traces (up to 0.88 hit rate) but poorly on high-churn or scan-heavy workloads.
- **Feedback**: The static partitioning effectively isolates the working set for specific traces but lacks the adaptability required to handle diverse access patterns found in the broader dataset.

- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.24, demonstrating strong adaptability on mixed workloads (up to 0.89 hit rate) while struggling with specific high-churn traces.
- **Feedback**: The implementation correctly captures the self-tuning nature of ARC to maximize hit rates, though the extensive state management and adaptation lag result in poor performance on datasets with rapidly shifting or massive working sets.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name implement_arc_algorithm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with S3-FIFO Nursery Hybrid**
- **Implementation**: This algorithm places a small FIFO nursery queue in front of an Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), promoting accessed nursery items to ARC's recency list while using ghost lists to dynamically tune the balance between recency and frequency segments.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.23, showing high variability with excellent hit rates on specific traces (e.g., 0.88) but near-zero performance on several others.
- **Feedback**: While the nursery effectively filters one-hit wonders, its integration likely disrupts ARC's ghost list learning mechanism for certain access patterns, preventing the algorithm from correctly adapting `p` and leading to instability across diverse workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name s3_fifo_arc_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO-D with Ghost Queue and Partitioned FIFO**
- **Implementation**: Implements a segmented FIFO strategy with a small probation queue (10% capacity) and a main queue, using a ghost cache to rescue evicted items and a second-chance mechanism for recurring hits in the main segment.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.25, excelling on stable workloads (e.g., trace 28 with 0.89) but performing poorly on scan-heavy traces (e.g., trace 14 with 0.00).
- **Feedback**: The fixed 10% probation size appears too rigid for workloads with high churn, suggesting that adaptive queue sizing or a more robust frequency filter is needed to handle diverse access patterns effectively.

**Program Name: LIRS Cache Eviction with Static HIR Buffer**
- **Implementation**: Implements the Low Inter-reference Recency Set (LIRS) algorithm using `OrderedDicts` for the history stack and resident queue, with a fixed 5% capacity reservation for HIR blocks.
- **Performance**: Achieves a composite score of 0.22, showing high effectiveness on stable, looping patterns (up to 88% hit rate) but near-zero performance on volatile traces.
- **Feedback**: While the LIRS logic effectively isolates the working set from scans, the static configuration and rigid promotion rules struggle to adapt to traces with rapidly shifting locality or random access patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name lirs_optimized - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Static W-TinyLFU with Segmented LRU**
- **Implementation**: Implements a W-TinyLFU architecture with a fixed 5% admission window and a Segmented LRU main cache, using frequency-based duels to decide whether to admit new items or retain existing ones.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25, demonstrating strong performance on frequency-biased workloads but failing significantly on scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: The static window size limits the algorithm's ability to adapt to changing workload patterns; implementing dynamic window sizing (as in Adaptive W-TinyLFU) could improve robustness across diverse traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name w_tinylfu_slru - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Randomized Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC)**
- **Implementation**: Maintains ARC's dual lists (recency/frequency) and adaptive parameter `p` using ghost entries, but utilizes random eviction within the selected list instead of LRU.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25 with highly variable hit rates, excelling on some workloads (0.89) but failing completely on others (0.00).
- **Feedback**: Replacing LRU with random eviction undermines ARC's recency tracking, significantly reducing effectiveness on standard locality traces despite the correctly implemented adaptive balancing logic.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the individual program summaries (Generations 80-89) and the Current Best Program, here are the actionable optimization insights.

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Implicit Incumbent Favoritism**: The **Current Best Program** (Score 0.27) uses a strict inequality (`freq_window > freq_main`) during eviction duels. This implicitly breaks ties in favor of the incumbent Main cache item. Comparative analysis shows that **Generation 82** (Score 0.26) and **Generation 84** (Score 0.26) tried to improve this with explicit biases ("+5 demotion bias" and "Ghost Shield"), but these modifications slightly reduced the score compared to the cleaner, implicit approach.
- **Secondary Probation Filtering**: The **Current Best Program** enforces a "2-hit" rule within the Probation segment before promoting an item to the Protected segment. **Generation 88** (Score 0.26) attempted a "Fast Promotion" mechanism to bypass this for high-frequency items but scored lower. This confirms that a strict secondary filter—preventing noise from polluting the Protected segment—is superior to aggressive promotion.
- **Demotion to Probation**: A critical pattern in the best implementation is handling Protected segment overflow by demoting items to the Probation segment rather than evicting them. This gives "warm" items a second chance to compete against new Window candidates. **Generation 80** (Score 0.23) applied strict frequency-based admission without this graceful demotion flow (or with too much bias), leading to worse performance.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Explicit Arithmetic Biasing**: Several programs attempted to artificially boost incumbent frequencies. **Generation 83** added a `+1` bias, and **Generation 80** used strong protection biases, resulting in scores of 0.24 and 0.23 respectively. Evaluation feedback indicates these explicit biases make the cache too rigid, causing it to fail on dynamic workloads where the **Current Best Program's** natural tie-breaking succeeds.
- **Window Size Expansion**: **Generation 85** (Score 0.24) increased the Window size to 5% to better handle scanning workloads. While this theoretically helps scans, the score dropped significantly compared to the **Current Best Program** (1% Window). The loss of Main cache capacity (reduced from 99% to 95%) outweighs the benefits on scan traces for this specific dataset.
- **Aggressive Admission Filtering**: **Generation 81** (Score 0.23) combined a 1% window with aggressive admission filtering. The feedback noted that this combination was too strict, evicting new items before they could prove their worth. The **Current Best Program** balances the 1% window with a standard Doorkeeper and fair aging (5x capacity) rather than aggressive rejection.

## Implementation Insights
- **Separate Probation State Tracking**: The **Current Best Program** utilizes a dedicated auxiliary dictionary, `probation_hits`, to track hit counts for items within the Probation segment. This implementation detail allows for stateful promotion logic (requiring 2 hits) without polluting the main object structure or the primary cache storage, facilitating cleaner state transitions compared to **Generation 82**.
- **Graceful Demotion Reset**: In the **Current Best Program**, when a Protected item is demoted, it is moved to the Probation segment (`state.probation[victim] = True`) but notably *without* an entry in `probation_hits`. This effectively resets its promotion eligibility, requiring it to prove itself again, which serves as a robust mechanism to filter out items that were once hot but have cooled down.
- **Strict Window Capacity Enforcement**: The `evict` function in the **Current Best Program** strictly checks `if len(state.window) >= state.window_size` to force an eviction decision. This implementation guarantees the Window never silently expands beyond 1%, preserving the exact 99% capacity for the SLRU structure, which is critical for the high hit rates (0.89) on Trace 28.

## Performance Analysis
- **The 0.27 Optimization Ceiling**: There is a clear performance plateau. The **Current Best Program** achieves 0.27, while highly optimized variants like **Generation 82**, **84**, and **88** cluster at 0.26. The 0.01 difference stems from the Best Program's ability to maintain peak performance on stable traces (Trace 28: ~0.89) by avoiding the complexity overhead of explicit biases or fast-promotion shortcuts.
- **Trace 14 vs. Trace 28 Trade-off**: Top-performing programs consistently accept a 0.00 hit rate on Trace 14 (looping scan) to maximize locality on Trace 28 (Zipfian). **Generation 85** attempted to improve scan performance (reaching 0.05 on scan) but saw its overall score drop to 0.24 due to losses on stable traces. This confirms that under the current scoring metric, optimizing for static locality is far more valuable than mitigating scan penalties.
- **Stability of the 1% Window**: Despite repeated feedback in **Generation 86, 87, 89** suggesting the 1% window is "too small," empirical results show it is the optimal configuration. Programs that alter this balance (e.g., adaptive windows or larger fixed sizes) consistently underperform (0.24 vs 0.27), proving that the 99% SLRU allocation is the primary driver of the high score.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the global insights and the current best program (Generation 69), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future mutations.

1.  **Grant "Second Chance" Status on Demotion**
    Modify the `update_after_hit` logic to set `state.probation_hits[victim] = True` immediately when an item is demoted from `protected` to `probation` due to overflow. Currently, demoted items are treated as raw newcomers requiring two hits to return; granting them "second chance" status allows these proven items to return to the protected segment with a single subsequent hit, reducing churn at the working set boundary.

2.  **Lower Frequency Saturation Cap**
    Reduce `self.max_freq` from 60 to **15** or **20**. The current cap creates too much inertia, causing "ghost" heavy hitters to persist long after they have stopped being relevant. A lower saturation point, combined with the existing 5x aging interval, will significantly improve the cache's ability to adapt to phase changes (dynamic workloads) while still maintaining the "Implicit Incumbent Favoritism" pattern.

3.  **Implement Segment-Dependent Eviction Logic**
    Refine the `evict` function to use different tie-breaking logic based on the victim's segment. Use `freq_window >= freq_main` (ties evict Main) if the victim is in the **Probation** segment, but maintain strictly `freq_window > freq_main` (ties keep Main) if the victim is in the **Protected** segment. This encourages faster turnover in the probation buffer for new content while strictly stabilizing the core protected segment against replacement.

4.  **Sketch-Accelerated Promotion**
    Update `update_after_hit` to allow immediate promotion from `probation` to `protected` if `state.get_freq(key)` exceeds a significant threshold (e.g., 5 or 10), even if the `probation_hits` condition is not met. This utilizes the persistent frequency sketch to fast-track historically heavy hitters that are re-entering the cache, allowing them to bypass the standard "two-hit" probationary requirement intended for unknown items.

5.  **Size-Based Doorkeeper Reset**
    Decouple the doorkeeper clearing mechanism from the frequency aging timer. Add a check in `record_access`: if `len(state.doorkeeper) > 2 * capacity`, clear the set immediately. This prevents the admission filter from becoming "clogged" with one-hit wonders during long periods between aging intervals, ensuring it remains an effective filter against scanning workloads.
