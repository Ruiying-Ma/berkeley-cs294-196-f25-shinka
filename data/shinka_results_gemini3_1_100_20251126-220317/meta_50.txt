# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Basic Dictionary-Based Least Recently Used (LRU)**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm tracks the most recent access time (access count) for each object in a global dictionary and evicts the object with the lowest timestamp value.
- **Performance**: It achieves a combined score of 0.21, performing strongly on traces with high temporal locality but poorly on scan-heavy or looping patterns.
- **Feedback**: While the logic correctly implements the standard LRU policy, the O(N) linear scan for the minimum timestamp is inefficient, and the lack of frequency tracking limits hit rates on non-recency-based workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: LFU-DA with Dynamic Aging and LRU Tie-Breaking**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm implements Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging (LFU-DA) by calculating priorities as frequency plus a global aging factor (the priority of the last evicted item), using a linear scan to identify the eviction victim.
- **Performance**: It achieved a combined score of 0.22, demonstrating strong performance on frequency-stable workloads (up to 0.88 hit rate) but failing completely on scan-heavy traces (0.00 hit rate).
- **Feedback**: While the dynamic aging factor effectively prevents cache pollution common in standard LFU, the algorithm lacks specific mechanisms to handle scan patterns and the $O(N)$ eviction search is computationally inefficient.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name lfuda_eviction - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Static S-Queue Allocation and Lazy Promotion**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes two queues (S for new, M for frequent) with a 10% static allocation for S, employing lazy promotion where accessed eviction candidates are moved to M.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.23, showing strong locality handling (hit rates >0.88) but poor performance on specific scan patterns (hit rates ~0.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation correctly separates one-hit wonders, but the fixed 10% S-queue size lacks adaptability for varying workload phases, causing significant drops in hit rate for certain traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name s3fifo_v1 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Segmented LRU with Fixed Protected Capacity**
- **Implementation**: This Segmented LRU (SLRU) implementation uses two `OrderedDict` segments, `probationary` and `protected`, promoting items to `protected` on hits with a fixed cap of 80% capacity. Overflow from `protected` demotes items back to `probationary`, and eviction strictly targets the LRU of the `probationary` segment first.
- **Performance**: It achieved a combined score of 0.23, with high efficiency on select patterns (up to 0.88) but near-zero hit rates on numerous other traces.
- **Feedback**: The rigid 80% protected limit provides scan resistance but likely starves the probationary segment during high churn, suggesting an adaptive partition size would improve consistency across diverse workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name slru_algorithm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: LeCaR with Randomized Policy Selection**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a probability weight to dynamically switch between LRU and LFU eviction, updating the weight via multiplicative updates when re-accessing previously evicted keys tracked in history buffers.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieves a low overall score of 0.21, with hit rates varying drastically from near 0% on many traces to 87% on specific stable workloads.
- **Feedback**: The probabilistic switching mechanism combined with a fixed learning rate appears too unstable for dynamic workloads, often failing to converge on an optimal policy quickly enough.

- **Implementation**: Maintains a small nursery queue (10%) and a main queue (90%) with a ghost cache to rescue frequently evicted items, using a 1-bit clock scheme for promotion and reinsertion.
- **Performance**: Combined score of 0.23, showing strong results on high-locality workloads (up to 88% hit rate) but near-zero performance on several specific traces.
- **Feedback**: The use of ghost caches and the S/M split provides effective scan resistance and frequency tracking, though the static 10% nursery size may lack flexibility for varying working set structures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name s3fifo - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Segmented LRU with Fixed 80% Protected Capacity**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes an ordered dictionary for global LRU tracking and a set to maintain a protected segment (fixed at 80% of cache) where items are promoted upon hits and the segment's LRU is demoted when full.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.23, performing well on stable frequency traces (up to 0.88 hit rate) but poorly on high-churn or scan-heavy workloads.
- **Feedback**: The static partitioning effectively isolates the working set for specific traces but lacks the adaptability required to handle diverse access patterns found in the broader dataset.

- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.24, demonstrating strong adaptability on mixed workloads (up to 0.89 hit rate) while struggling with specific high-churn traces.
- **Feedback**: The implementation correctly captures the self-tuning nature of ARC to maximize hit rates, though the extensive state management and adaptation lag result in poor performance on datasets with rapidly shifting or massive working sets.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name implement_arc_algorithm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with S3-FIFO Nursery Hybrid**
- **Implementation**: This algorithm places a small FIFO nursery queue in front of an Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), promoting accessed nursery items to ARC's recency list while using ghost lists to dynamically tune the balance between recency and frequency segments.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.23, showing high variability with excellent hit rates on specific traces (e.g., 0.88) but near-zero performance on several others.
- **Feedback**: While the nursery effectively filters one-hit wonders, its integration likely disrupts ARC's ghost list learning mechanism for certain access patterns, preventing the algorithm from correctly adapting `p` and leading to instability across diverse workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name s3_fifo_arc_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO-D with Ghost Queue and Partitioned FIFO**
- **Implementation**: Implements a segmented FIFO strategy with a small probation queue (10% capacity) and a main queue, using a ghost cache to rescue evicted items and a second-chance mechanism for recurring hits in the main segment.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.25, excelling on stable workloads (e.g., trace 28 with 0.89) but performing poorly on scan-heavy traces (e.g., trace 14 with 0.00).
- **Feedback**: The fixed 10% probation size appears too rigid for workloads with high churn, suggesting that adaptive queue sizing or a more robust frequency filter is needed to handle diverse access patterns effectively.

**Program Name: LIRS Cache Eviction with Static HIR Buffer**
- **Implementation**: Implements the Low Inter-reference Recency Set (LIRS) algorithm using `OrderedDicts` for the history stack and resident queue, with a fixed 5% capacity reservation for HIR blocks.
- **Performance**: Achieves a composite score of 0.22, showing high effectiveness on stable, looping patterns (up to 88% hit rate) but near-zero performance on volatile traces.
- **Feedback**: While the LIRS logic effectively isolates the working set from scans, the static configuration and rigid promotion rules struggle to adapt to traces with rapidly shifting locality or random access patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name lirs_optimized - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Static W-TinyLFU with Segmented LRU**
- **Implementation**: Implements a W-TinyLFU architecture with a fixed 5% admission window and a Segmented LRU main cache, using frequency-based duels to decide whether to admit new items or retain existing ones.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25, demonstrating strong performance on frequency-biased workloads but failing significantly on scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: The static window size limits the algorithm's ability to adapt to changing workload patterns; implementing dynamic window sizing (as in Adaptive W-TinyLFU) could improve robustness across diverse traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name w_tinylfu_slru - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Randomized Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC)**
- **Implementation**: Maintains ARC's dual lists (recency/frequency) and adaptive parameter `p` using ghost entries, but utilizes random eviction within the selected list instead of LRU.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25 with highly variable hit rates, excelling on some workloads (0.89) but failing completely on others (0.00).
- **Feedback**: Replacing LRU with random eviction undermines ARC's recency tracking, significantly reducing effectiveness on standard locality traces despite the correctly implemented adaptive balancing logic.

- **Performance**: The algorithm achieves a combined score of 0.23, performing exceptionally well on frequency-heavy traces (up to 88% hit rate) but poorly on recency-based or scanning workloads.
- **Feedback**: The static 1% window is likely too restrictive for many access patterns, and the strict admission policy causes significant misses on traces with shifting working sets or low reuse.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name tuned_wtinylfu_params - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with Doorkeeper and SLRU Segmentation**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm partitions cache into a 5% Window LRU and a segmented Main SLRU (Probation/Protected), using a Doorkeeper filter and frequency-based dueling with periodic aging to govern admission.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25, performing exceptionally well on frequency-heavy traces (up to 0.89 hit rate) but failing significantly on scan-heavy workloads (near 0.00).
- **Feedback**: While the admission policy effectively isolates hot items in stable distributions, the aggressive protection of high-frequency items likely prevents the cache from adapting to new working sets or scans, causing the Window to churn without promoting new content.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 46 - Patch Name optimize_promotion_and_frequency - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with SLRU and Doorkeeper Frequency Filter**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes a small admission window (2%) and a segmented SLRU (Probation/Protected) for the main cache, employing a frequency-based "duel" between window and main victims to determine eviction.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.26, with strong results on repetitive patterns (e.g., 0.88 on trace 28) but near-zero hit rates on several scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: The very small window size effectively filters one-time access patterns but likely discards valid items too early in high-churn workloads; adjusting the window ratio or aging mechanism could improve versatility.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 47 - Patch Name increase_window_and_freq_cap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU Lite with Window-SLRU Segmentation**
- **Implementation**: Features a 1% LRU Window and a Main SLRU (Probation/Protected) structure, where eviction candidates from the Window duel Probation items based on accumulated frequencies to determine admission.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.21, demonstrating high variance with excellent hit rates on specific traces (up to 0.87) but near-zero performance on others.
- **Feedback**: The aggressive 1% window configuration effectively prioritizes high-frequency items in stable workloads but likely discards new items too quickly in dynamic or scan-heavy scenarios, leading to poor adaptability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 48 - Patch Name wtinylfu_lite - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU Cache with Doorkeeper and Frequency Aging**
- **Implementation**: Implements a segmented cache (Window, Probation, Protected) with TinyLFU-style admission, using a Doorkeeper for new items and periodic frequency halving to adapt to shifts.
- **Performance**: Achieved a score of 0.24, showing high hit rates on looping traces (e.g., 0.88 on trace 28) but near-zero on several others.
- **Feedback**: The frequency-based admission effectively filters pollution in stable workloads, but the small fixed window (5%) may be insufficient for capturing transient locality or scans.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 49 - Patch Name tune_wtinylfu_params - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

# Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Static 1% Window with SLRU Optimization**: The Current Best Program (Generation 44, Score 0.27) achieved the highest performance by reducing the admission window to a static 1% of capacity, coupled with a 99% SLRU Main cache. This configuration outperformed the 5% window variants (Generation 40, Score 0.26) and 2% variants (Generation 47, Score 0.26). The smaller window maximizes the size of the Protected segment, which is critical for the high-locality traces that dominate the scoring, despite sacrificing performance on scan-heavy traces.
- **Doorkeeper-Filtered Frequency Dueling**: The most effective admission policy (Generation 44, 40) utilizes a "Doorkeeper" (a simple set for tracking first sightings) to filter items before they enter the main frequency map. When `freq_w > freq_m` is evaluated during the eviction duel, this two-tier tracking ensures that only items with confirmed recurrence compete against established cache residents, significantly reducing cache pollution from one-off items.
- **Demotion-Based SLRU Management**: Successful programs (Generation 44) implement a specific flow for handling Protected segment overflow: victims are not evicted but "demoted" back to the Probation segment (`state.probation[victim] = True`). This gives valuable items a second chance to prove their utility in Probation before facing the strict admission duel, effectively maintaining a robust tiered hierarchy.

# Ineffective Approaches
- **Strict Promotion Thresholds**: Implementations that increased the difficulty of promotion from Probation to Protected by requiring more than one hit (e.g., Generation 41 and 45 requiring `access_count > 2`) performed poorly (Score 0.23-0.25). This added friction prevented the cache from quickly stabilizing working sets in the Protected segment, causing valid items to cycle out of Probation too early.
- **Adaptive Window Sizing Complexity**: Generation 42 attempted to dynamically resize the window based on ghost list hits (Adaptive W-TinyLFU) but only achieved a score of 0.26, failing to beat the static tuned 1% version. The overhead and potential lag in adaptation logic proved less effective than a rigorously optimized static configuration for this specific dataset.
- **W-TinyLFU "Lite" Simplifications**: Generation 48 attempted a simplified "Lite" version of W-TinyLFU but suffered from high variance and a lower score (0.21). Removing the robust SLRU segmentation or Doorkeeper logic reduced the algorithm's ability to discriminate between frequency tiers, confirming that the full complexity of the standard architecture is necessary.

# Implementation Insights
- **Standardized Window Growth Logic**: The Current Best Program (Generation 44) employs a critical logic in the `evict` function: if the cache is full but the Window segment is not yet at its target capacity (1%), it forces an eviction from the Main cache (Probation/Protected). This ensures the admission window is always "open" to receive new items up to its reserved size, preventing the window from being starved by a full Main cache.
  ```python
  if len(state.window) >= state.window_size:
      # Perform Duel
  else:
      # Window not full: Evict from Main to allow Window growth
      return next(iter(state.probation)) if state.probation else ...
  ```
- **Frequency Aging Rate**: The aging strategy in the top performer (Generation 44) settles on halving frequencies every `5 * capacity` accesses. This interval is long enough to retain history for looping patterns (Trace 28 hit rate 0.89) but frequent enough to allow the cache to adapt to phase changes, outperforming the faster `1 * capacity` aging seen in earlier failed attempts.
- **Efficient Python Structures for Segmentation**: The best implementation explicitly uses `collections.OrderedDict` for `window`, `probation`, and `protected` segments. This allows for $O(1)$ LRU operations (`move_to_end`, `popitem(last=False)`) which are essential for managing the complex movement of items between segments (Promotion, Demotion, Eviction) without timeout violations.

# Performance Analysis
- **The 0.27 Score Ceiling**: Generation 44 broke the previous 0.26 ceiling by optimizing the window-to-main ratio (1:99). This suggests that for the current trace set, the marginal gain from a larger Protected segment (better hit rates on Zipfian/repeating traces) outweighs the marginal loss of scan resistance provided by a larger Window.
- **Scan vs. Locality Trade-off**: A clear polarization exists in the results. The Best Program scores 0.00 on Trace 14 (likely a scan or sparse trace) while scoring 0.89 on Trace 28 (looping). The 1% window is too small to buffer scans effectively, resulting in a near-zero hit rate for those patterns. Programs attempting to balance this (e.g., Gen 40 with 5% window) scored lower overall (0.26), indicating that optimizing for the "common case" of high locality is the winning strategy for the aggregate score.
- **Stability of Frequency-Based Approaches**: Programs relying on frequency counts (Gen 40, 44, 46) consistently score in the 0.25-0.27 range, whereas pure LRU or simplified variants often drop below 0.22. This confirms that frequency-based admission (TinyLFU) combined with Recency-based segmentation (SLRU) is the robust local optimum for this contest.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the analysis of the current best program (Generation 44) and the global insights, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future program mutations:

1.  **Relax SLRU Promotion Criteria**
    Modify the `update_after_hit` function to promote items from the `probation` segment to the `protected` segment immediately upon their **first hit** in `probation`, rather than requiring a second hit (tracked via `probation_hits`). The current two-hit requirement creates excessive friction, preventing the `protected` segment—which holds 80% of the capacity—from filling quickly with the working set on high-locality traces.

2.  **Condition Preemptive Main Eviction**
    Refine the eviction logic that unconditionally prioritizes Window growth (`if len(window) < window_size: evict from Main`). Add a check: if the candidate victim from the Main cache (Probation LRU) has a frequency count greater than 0, **spare it and evict from the Window instead**. This change prevents the cache from flushing valuable, established items to make room for potentially useless scan items during the "Make room for Window" phase.

3.  **Implement Size-Based Doorkeeper Reset**
    Decouple the Doorkeeper clearing from the frequency aging interval. Instead of clearing the `doorkeeper` set every `5 * capacity` accesses, clear it only when its size exceeds a fixed threshold (e.g., `2 * capacity`). This allows the Doorkeeper to retain "seen-once" history for a longer duration, improving the filter's ability to identify and reject one-off items from slow scans without the periodic amnesia caused by the aging timer.

4.  **Introduce an Eviction Duel Bias**
    Modify the TinyLFU duel comparison to include a bias factor favoring the Main cache residents. Change the eviction condition from `if freq_w > freq_m` to `if freq_w > freq_m + 1`. This adds "inertia" to the Main cache, ensuring that established items are not replaced by new arrivals that merely have an equal or marginally higher frequency, thereby reducing churn in the stable working set.

5.  **Lower Frequency Saturation Cap**
    Reduce the `max_freq` cap from 60 to **15**. With the current aging schedule (halving every `5 * capacity`), a cap of 60 retains history for too long (~30x capacity accesses), causing "ghosts" of past heavy hitters to pollute the cache. A lower cap allows the cache to adapt more rapidly to phase changes while still distinguishing between one-off items (freq 0/1) and the working set (freq > 1).
