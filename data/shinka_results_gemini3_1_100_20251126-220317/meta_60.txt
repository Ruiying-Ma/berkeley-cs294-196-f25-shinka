# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Basic Dictionary-Based Least Recently Used (LRU)**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm tracks the most recent access time (access count) for each object in a global dictionary and evicts the object with the lowest timestamp value.
- **Performance**: It achieves a combined score of 0.21, performing strongly on traces with high temporal locality but poorly on scan-heavy or looping patterns.
- **Feedback**: While the logic correctly implements the standard LRU policy, the O(N) linear scan for the minimum timestamp is inefficient, and the lack of frequency tracking limits hit rates on non-recency-based workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: LFU-DA with Dynamic Aging and LRU Tie-Breaking**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm implements Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging (LFU-DA) by calculating priorities as frequency plus a global aging factor (the priority of the last evicted item), using a linear scan to identify the eviction victim.
- **Performance**: It achieved a combined score of 0.22, demonstrating strong performance on frequency-stable workloads (up to 0.88 hit rate) but failing completely on scan-heavy traces (0.00 hit rate).
- **Feedback**: While the dynamic aging factor effectively prevents cache pollution common in standard LFU, the algorithm lacks specific mechanisms to handle scan patterns and the $O(N)$ eviction search is computationally inefficient.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name lfuda_eviction - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Static S-Queue Allocation and Lazy Promotion**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes two queues (S for new, M for frequent) with a 10% static allocation for S, employing lazy promotion where accessed eviction candidates are moved to M.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.23, showing strong locality handling (hit rates >0.88) but poor performance on specific scan patterns (hit rates ~0.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation correctly separates one-hit wonders, but the fixed 10% S-queue size lacks adaptability for varying workload phases, causing significant drops in hit rate for certain traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name s3fifo_v1 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Segmented LRU with Fixed Protected Capacity**
- **Implementation**: This Segmented LRU (SLRU) implementation uses two `OrderedDict` segments, `probationary` and `protected`, promoting items to `protected` on hits with a fixed cap of 80% capacity. Overflow from `protected` demotes items back to `probationary`, and eviction strictly targets the LRU of the `probationary` segment first.
- **Performance**: It achieved a combined score of 0.23, with high efficiency on select patterns (up to 0.88) but near-zero hit rates on numerous other traces.
- **Feedback**: The rigid 80% protected limit provides scan resistance but likely starves the probationary segment during high churn, suggesting an adaptive partition size would improve consistency across diverse workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name slru_algorithm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: LeCaR with Randomized Policy Selection**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a probability weight to dynamically switch between LRU and LFU eviction, updating the weight via multiplicative updates when re-accessing previously evicted keys tracked in history buffers.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieves a low overall score of 0.21, with hit rates varying drastically from near 0% on many traces to 87% on specific stable workloads.
- **Feedback**: The probabilistic switching mechanism combined with a fixed learning rate appears too unstable for dynamic workloads, often failing to converge on an optimal policy quickly enough.

- **Implementation**: Maintains a small nursery queue (10%) and a main queue (90%) with a ghost cache to rescue frequently evicted items, using a 1-bit clock scheme for promotion and reinsertion.
- **Performance**: Combined score of 0.23, showing strong results on high-locality workloads (up to 88% hit rate) but near-zero performance on several specific traces.
- **Feedback**: The use of ghost caches and the S/M split provides effective scan resistance and frequency tracking, though the static 10% nursery size may lack flexibility for varying working set structures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name s3fifo - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Segmented LRU with Fixed 80% Protected Capacity**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes an ordered dictionary for global LRU tracking and a set to maintain a protected segment (fixed at 80% of cache) where items are promoted upon hits and the segment's LRU is demoted when full.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.23, performing well on stable frequency traces (up to 0.88 hit rate) but poorly on high-churn or scan-heavy workloads.
- **Feedback**: The static partitioning effectively isolates the working set for specific traces but lacks the adaptability required to handle diverse access patterns found in the broader dataset.

- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.24, demonstrating strong adaptability on mixed workloads (up to 0.89 hit rate) while struggling with specific high-churn traces.
- **Feedback**: The implementation correctly captures the self-tuning nature of ARC to maximize hit rates, though the extensive state management and adaptation lag result in poor performance on datasets with rapidly shifting or massive working sets.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name implement_arc_algorithm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with S3-FIFO Nursery Hybrid**
- **Implementation**: This algorithm places a small FIFO nursery queue in front of an Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), promoting accessed nursery items to ARC's recency list while using ghost lists to dynamically tune the balance between recency and frequency segments.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.23, showing high variability with excellent hit rates on specific traces (e.g., 0.88) but near-zero performance on several others.
- **Feedback**: While the nursery effectively filters one-hit wonders, its integration likely disrupts ARC's ghost list learning mechanism for certain access patterns, preventing the algorithm from correctly adapting `p` and leading to instability across diverse workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name s3_fifo_arc_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO-D with Ghost Queue and Partitioned FIFO**
- **Implementation**: Implements a segmented FIFO strategy with a small probation queue (10% capacity) and a main queue, using a ghost cache to rescue evicted items and a second-chance mechanism for recurring hits in the main segment.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.25, excelling on stable workloads (e.g., trace 28 with 0.89) but performing poorly on scan-heavy traces (e.g., trace 14 with 0.00).
- **Feedback**: The fixed 10% probation size appears too rigid for workloads with high churn, suggesting that adaptive queue sizing or a more robust frequency filter is needed to handle diverse access patterns effectively.

**Program Name: LIRS Cache Eviction with Static HIR Buffer**
- **Implementation**: Implements the Low Inter-reference Recency Set (LIRS) algorithm using `OrderedDicts` for the history stack and resident queue, with a fixed 5% capacity reservation for HIR blocks.
- **Performance**: Achieves a composite score of 0.22, showing high effectiveness on stable, looping patterns (up to 88% hit rate) but near-zero performance on volatile traces.
- **Feedback**: While the LIRS logic effectively isolates the working set from scans, the static configuration and rigid promotion rules struggle to adapt to traces with rapidly shifting locality or random access patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name lirs_optimized - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Static W-TinyLFU with Segmented LRU**
- **Implementation**: Implements a W-TinyLFU architecture with a fixed 5% admission window and a Segmented LRU main cache, using frequency-based duels to decide whether to admit new items or retain existing ones.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25, demonstrating strong performance on frequency-biased workloads but failing significantly on scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: The static window size limits the algorithm's ability to adapt to changing workload patterns; implementing dynamic window sizing (as in Adaptive W-TinyLFU) could improve robustness across diverse traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name w_tinylfu_slru - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Randomized Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC)**
- **Implementation**: Maintains ARC's dual lists (recency/frequency) and adaptive parameter `p` using ghost entries, but utilizes random eviction within the selected list instead of LRU.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25 with highly variable hit rates, excelling on some workloads (0.89) but failing completely on others (0.00).
- **Feedback**: Replacing LRU with random eviction undermines ARC's recency tracking, significantly reducing effectiveness on standard locality traces despite the correctly implemented adaptive balancing logic.

- **Performance**: The algorithm achieves a combined score of 0.23, performing exceptionally well on frequency-heavy traces (up to 88% hit rate) but poorly on recency-based or scanning workloads.
- **Feedback**: The static 1% window is likely too restrictive for many access patterns, and the strict admission policy causes significant misses on traces with shifting working sets or low reuse.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 45 - Patch Name tuned_wtinylfu_params - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with Doorkeeper and SLRU Segmentation**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm partitions cache into a 5% Window LRU and a segmented Main SLRU (Probation/Protected), using a Doorkeeper filter and frequency-based dueling with periodic aging to govern admission.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25, performing exceptionally well on frequency-heavy traces (up to 0.89 hit rate) but failing significantly on scan-heavy workloads (near 0.00).
- **Feedback**: While the admission policy effectively isolates hot items in stable distributions, the aggressive protection of high-frequency items likely prevents the cache from adapting to new working sets or scans, causing the Window to churn without promoting new content.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 46 - Patch Name optimize_promotion_and_frequency - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with SLRU and Doorkeeper Frequency Filter**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes a small admission window (2%) and a segmented SLRU (Probation/Protected) for the main cache, employing a frequency-based "duel" between window and main victims to determine eviction.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.26, with strong results on repetitive patterns (e.g., 0.88 on trace 28) but near-zero hit rates on several scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: The very small window size effectively filters one-time access patterns but likely discards valid items too early in high-churn workloads; adjusting the window ratio or aging mechanism could improve versatility.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 47 - Patch Name increase_window_and_freq_cap - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU Lite with Window-SLRU Segmentation**
- **Implementation**: Features a 1% LRU Window and a Main SLRU (Probation/Protected) structure, where eviction candidates from the Window duel Probation items based on accumulated frequencies to determine admission.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.21, demonstrating high variance with excellent hit rates on specific traces (up to 0.87) but near-zero performance on others.
- **Feedback**: The aggressive 1% window configuration effectively prioritizes high-frequency items in stable workloads but likely discards new items too quickly in dynamic or scan-heavy scenarios, leading to poor adaptability.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 48 - Patch Name wtinylfu_lite - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU Cache with Doorkeeper and Frequency Aging**
- **Implementation**: Implements a segmented cache (Window, Probation, Protected) with TinyLFU-style admission, using a Doorkeeper for new items and periodic frequency halving to adapt to shifts.
- **Performance**: Achieved a score of 0.24, showing high hit rates on looping traces (e.g., 0.88 on trace 28) but near-zero on several others.
- **Feedback**: The frequency-based admission effectively filters pollution in stable workloads, but the small fixed window (5%) may be insufficient for capturing transient locality or scans.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 49 - Patch Name tune_wtinylfu_params - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with Doorkeeper, Aging, and Biased Protection**
- **Implementation**: Uses a 1% admission window and SLRU main cache, featuring a size-limited Doorkeeper, frequency aging every 5x capacity, and an admission duel heavily biased towards retaining main cache items.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.27, excelling on stable workloads but performing poorly on dynamic traces.
- **Feedback**: The strong bias favoring main cache retention (requiring window frequency > main frequency + 1) likely prevents the cache from adapting quickly to new working sets, creating resistance to workload changes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 50 - Patch Name wtinylfu_biased_dk_refined - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Biased W-TinyLFU with Size-Based Doorkeeper**
- **Implementation**: Implements W-TinyLFU with a 1% admission window and SLRU main cache, employing a biased eviction duel (`window_freq > main_freq + 1`) to favor retaining existing items and a Doorkeeper reset triggered by capacity thresholds.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.27, performing strongly on repetitive workloads (e.g., 0.89 on trace 28) but poorly on scan-heavy traces (e.g., 0.00 on trace 14).
- **Feedback**: The biased duel effectively stabilizes the cache against churn by requiring significant frequency evidence for admission, but the small window size leaves the algorithm vulnerable to rapid access pattern changes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 51 - Patch Name wtinylfu_biased - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with Doorkeeper and SLRU**
- **Implementation**: This policy integrates a 1% Window LRU with a Segmented LRU (Probation/Protected) Main cache, employing a Doorkeeper mechanism to filter rare items before tracking their frequency for TinyLFU-based admission duels.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.26, performing exceptionally well on high-locality traces (up to 88%) but suffering near-zero hit rates on several specific workloads.
- **Feedback**: While the Doorkeeper and SLRU structure effectively manage established hot items, the extremely small window size combined with the specific admission filtering likely caused the poor performance on traces requiring faster adaptation or larger capture buffers.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 52 - Patch Name optimize_tinylfu_parameters_and_logic - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with Static Window and Frequency Sketch**
- **Implementation**: Implements W-TinyLFU using a 1% Window LRU and segmented Main LRU (Probation/Protected) governed by a TinyLFU admission policy with a frequency dictionary and Doorkeeper set.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.21, performing well on high-locality workloads but suffering near-zero hit rates on scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: The static 1% window size is likely too small for recency-heavy workloads, and the lack of adaptive sizing prevents the cache from adjusting to varying traffic patterns effectively.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 53 - Patch Name wtinylfu_opt - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Adaptive S3-FIFO with ARC-style Ghosts**
- **Implementation**: Implements a two-queue system (Small/Main) where the Small queue's size dynamically adjusts based on ghost list hits, mimicking ARC's adaptive logic. Uses hit counts for second-chance promotion from Small to Main and retention within Main.
- **Performance**: Combined score of 0.24; performs well on select traces but poorly on many others (e.g., < 5% hit rate).
- **Feedback**: The adaptation logic appears unstable, leading to cache thrashing on specific workloads; while the ghost-based resizing is clever, it often fails to retain the working set effectively compared to simpler static policies.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 54 - Patch Name adaptive_s3_fifo - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with SLRU Main Cache and Doorkeeper**
- **Implementation**: Implements a Window-TinyLFU architecture using a 5% admission window, a Segmented LRU (SLRU) main cache, and a Doorkeeper-based frequency counter with periodic aging.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.26, performing well on high-frequency traces (0.76-0.88) but poorly on scan-heavy or looping workloads (0.00-0.02).
- **Feedback**: The combination of SLRU and frequency-based admission effectively protects hot items in static distributions, but the static window size or admission duel appears too rigid for scans or shifting working sets where new items fail to displace incumbents.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 55 - Patch Name improved_tinylfu_eviction - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with Doorkeeper and Adaptive Frequency Aging**
- **Implementation**: Combines a small admission Window with an SLRU main cache, using a Doorkeeper to filter rare items and halving frequencies every 5x capacity. Eviction relies on a duel between Window and Main victims, biased to favor the Main cache unless the new item has a strictly higher frequency.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25, excelling on stable traces (e.g., 0.88 hit rate) but performing poorly on high-churn or scanning workloads.
- **Feedback**: The biased eviction and slow aging (5x capacity) effectively protect against pollution in static environments but make the cache too rigid to adapt to shifting working sets or distinct phases.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 56 - Patch Name optimize_parameters_and_duel - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with Doorkeeper and Biased Window Duel**
- **Implementation**: This W-TinyLFU adaptation employs a 1% admission window, segmented SLRU main cache, and a size-resetting Doorkeeper, determining eviction via a duel that strongly biases against window admission.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined hit rate of 0.27, performing well on static frequency distributions but poorly on traces with rapid churn or scans.
- **Feedback**: The strong bias against admitting items from the small window effectively protects the cache from pollution but hinders adaptation to shifting workloads, resulting in near-zero hit rates on specific dynamic traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 57 - Patch Name wtinylfu_optimized - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: W-TinyLFU with Doorkeeper and Aggressive Admission Policy**
- **Implementation**: Combines a 1% LRU window and an SLRU main cache, using a Doorkeeper-filtered frequency counter with periodic aging. The eviction policy heavily biases against new items, requiring the window candidate's frequency to strictly exceed the main candidate's by a margin (`fw > fm + 1`) to survive.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieves a combined score of 0.27, showing strong locality capture on some traces but failing completely (near 0% hit rate) on others.
- **Feedback**: The strict admission criteria and tiny window size likely prevent the cache from adapting to shifts in the working set, as new items are evicted before they can accumulate enough frequency to displace existing entries.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 58 - Patch Name w_tinylfu_doorkeeper_optimized - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Optimized W-TinyLFU with Doorkeeper and SLRU**
- **Implementation**: Combines a small 1% Window LRU and 99% SLRU Main cache with Doorkeeper frequency tracking, employing a biased eviction duel that aggressively protects Main items with any history (`freq > 0`) over growing the Window.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.26, showing high hit rates on stable distributions but near-zero performance on several dynamic or scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: The "Spare Main" logic is likely too conservative, causing new items in the Window to be evicted immediately if the Main victim has any frequency count; this prevents the Window from effectively filtering new content and adapting to workload changes.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 59 - Patch Name optimized_wtinylfu_slru - Correct Program: True

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

# Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Incumbency-Biased Admission Duels**: The highest-performing programs (Generation 50, 51, 58, Score 0.27) implement a specific eviction duel that heavily favors retaining the Main cache victim. By requiring the Window candidate to have a frequency strictly greater than the Main victim plus a margin (e.g., `freq_window > freq_main + 1`), these algorithms stabilize the cache against churn, maximizing hits on high-locality traces (Trace 28 hit rate ~0.89).
- **Two-Stage SLRU Promotion Filter**: The Current Best Program refines the SLRU logic by requiring a stricter promotion threshold. Items in the Probation segment are not promoted to Protected on the first hit; instead, they are marked in a `probation_hits` structure and only promoted on a subsequent access. This secondary filter, working alongside the Doorkeeper, ensures the large Protected segment (79% of capacity) is reserved for truly high-frequency items.
- **Static 1% Window Configuration**: Consistent with previous findings, the 1% Window / 99% SLRU split remains the local optimum (Score 0.27). Attempts to increase the window to 5% (Generation 55) resulted in a score drop to 0.26, confirming that for this dataset, the marginal utility of a larger Protected segment outweighs the scan-resistance benefits of a larger admission window.

# Ineffective Approaches
- **Conservative "Spare Main" Logic**: Generation 59 (Score 0.26) attempted to protect any Main cache item with a non-zero frequency (`freq > 0`) against eviction by a Window item. This approach proved too rigid, effectively locking the cache state and preventing new, moderately popular items from displacing decaying incumbents, leading to lower scores than the frequency-margin based duels.
- **Adaptive Window Sizing**: Generation 54 (Score 0.24) failed to match the performance of static tuning using an Adaptive S3-FIFO approach. The feedback indicates the adaptation logic was unstable, causing the cache to thrash rather than settle on an optimal window size for the workload phases.
- **Broad Promotion Thresholds**: While the successful logic requires multiple hits for promotion, earlier or alternative implementations that promoted items from Probation to Protected too easily (on the first hit) or lacked the demotion-to-probation cycle failed to achieve the 0.27 ceiling, likely due to pollution of the Protected segment with transient items.

# Implementation Insights
- **Forced Window Availability**: The `evict` function in the best implementation employs a critical check: `if len(state.window) >= state.window_size`. If the window is not full, the algorithm forces an eviction from the Main cache (Probation or Protected) instead of the Window. This logic guarantees that the admission window always remains "open" to process new arrivals, preventing the large Main cache from starving the intake mechanism.
- **Pythonic Frequency Tracking**: The best programs utilize standard Python `dict` and `set` structures for the Frequency Sketch and Doorkeeper rather than complex probabilistic data structures. This provides O(1) access speed and sufficient accuracy for the cache sizes involved, avoiding the timeout penalties seen in more complex implementations.
- **Demotion-Based Overflow Handling**: A key implementation detail in the high-scoring SLRU logic is the handling of Protected segment overflow. Rather than evicting items directly, the LRU item from the Protected segment is "demoted" back to Probation (`state.probation[victim] = True`). This gives valuable items a graceful degradation path, allowing them to be re-promoted if accessed again, rather than being immediately discarded.

# Performance Analysis
- **The Locality vs. Scan Polarization**: The 0.27 score ceiling is characterized by extreme performance polarization. The best programs achieve near-perfect capture on looping traces (e.g., Trace 28: 0.89, Trace 27: 0.84) but sacrifice performance entirely on scan-heavy traces (e.g., Trace 14: 0.00). This indicates the scoring metric heavily favors "deep" caching of static working sets over "wide" buffering of scans.
- **Rigidity as a Feature**: The feedback for high-scoring programs (Gen 50, 51, 58) consistently notes "poor performance on dynamic traces" and "resistance to workload changes." Paradoxically, this rigidity is what allows them to score 0.27. By treating the workload as largely static and refusing to adapt quickly (via high admission thresholds), these algorithms avoid being distracted by noise in the trace data.
- **Frequency-Bias Correlation**: There is a direct correlation between the strength of the bias against new items and the final score. Programs requiring `fw > fm + 1` consistently score 0.27, while those with standard `fw > fm` or simple LRU logic float between 0.21 and 0.26. This suggests that the "cost" of admitting a new item must be artificially inflated to protect the accumulated value of the existing cache content.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the global insights and the analysis of the current best program, here are 5 actionable recommendations for future mutations:

1.  **Implement Incumbency-Biased Eviction Duel**
    Modify the TinyLFU duel in the `evict` function to strictly favor the Main cache victim. Change the replacement condition from `freq_w > freq_m` to `freq_w > freq_m + 1`. This introduces a "hysteresis" or margin that prevents new, marginally popular items from displacing established residents, directly correlating with the Score 0.27 ceiling observed in generations 50, 51, and 58.

2.  **Decouple Doorkeeper Reset from Aging**
    Change the Doorkeeper clearing logic. Instead of clearing `self.doorkeeper` every time `self.age()` is called (every 5x capacity), clear it only when `len(self.doorkeeper)` exceeds a size threshold (e.g., `2 * capacity`). This prevents "amnesia" where the filter forgets recently seen one-off items just because the aging timer triggered, thereby improving scan resistance.

3.  **Lower Frequency Saturation Cap**
    Reduce `self.max_freq` from 60 to **15**. With the current halving strategy, a cap of 60 retains "ghost" history for too long (~30-60x capacity accesses). A lower cap ensures that the frequency sketch adapts faster to phase changes while still sufficiently distinguishing between one-hit wonders (freq 1) and the working set (freq > 1).

4.  **Grant "Second Chance" Credit on Demotion**
    Modify `update_after_hit` to preserve the status of items demoted from `protected`. When an item overflows from `protected` to `probation`, immediately set `state.probation_hits[victim] = True`. This treats the demoted item as a "trusted" candidate that only requires one hit to return to the protected segment, rather than forcing it to earn two hits like a completely new arrival.

5.  **Extend Frequency Aging Interval**
    Increase the `aging_interval` from `capacity * 5` to `capacity * 10`. The performance analysis indicates that "rigidity is a feature" and high scores come from locking onto static working sets. Slowing down the decay rate reduces churn and reinforces the cache's ability to hold onto high-value items during longer loop periods.
