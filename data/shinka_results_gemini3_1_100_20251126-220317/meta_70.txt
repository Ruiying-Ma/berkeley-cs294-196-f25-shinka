# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM SUMMARIES

The following are summaries of individual programs evaluated since the last meta update:

**Program Name: Basic Dictionary-Based Least Recently Used (LRU)**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm tracks the most recent access time (access count) for each object in a global dictionary and evicts the object with the lowest timestamp value.
- **Performance**: It achieves a combined score of 0.21, performing strongly on traces with high temporal locality but poorly on scan-heavy or looping patterns.
- **Feedback**: While the logic correctly implements the standard LRU policy, the O(N) linear scan for the minimum timestamp is inefficient, and the lack of frequency tracking limits hit rates on non-recency-based workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 0 - Patch Name initial_program - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: LFU-DA with Dynamic Aging and LRU Tie-Breaking**
- **Implementation**: The algorithm implements Least Frequently Used with Dynamic Aging (LFU-DA) by calculating priorities as frequency plus a global aging factor (the priority of the last evicted item), using a linear scan to identify the eviction victim.
- **Performance**: It achieved a combined score of 0.22, demonstrating strong performance on frequency-stable workloads (up to 0.88 hit rate) but failing completely on scan-heavy traces (0.00 hit rate).
- **Feedback**: While the dynamic aging factor effectively prevents cache pollution common in standard LFU, the algorithm lacks specific mechanisms to handle scan patterns and the $O(N)$ eviction search is computationally inefficient.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 1 - Patch Name lfuda_eviction - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO with Static S-Queue Allocation and Lazy Promotion**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes two queues (S for new, M for frequent) with a 10% static allocation for S, employing lazy promotion where accessed eviction candidates are moved to M.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.23, showing strong locality handling (hit rates >0.88) but poor performance on specific scan patterns (hit rates ~0.00).
- **Feedback**: The implementation correctly separates one-hit wonders, but the fixed 10% S-queue size lacks adaptability for varying workload phases, causing significant drops in hit rate for certain traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 2 - Patch Name s3fifo_v1 - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Segmented LRU with Fixed Protected Capacity**
- **Implementation**: This Segmented LRU (SLRU) implementation uses two `OrderedDict` segments, `probationary` and `protected`, promoting items to `protected` on hits with a fixed cap of 80% capacity. Overflow from `protected` demotes items back to `probationary`, and eviction strictly targets the LRU of the `probationary` segment first.
- **Performance**: It achieved a combined score of 0.23, with high efficiency on select patterns (up to 0.88) but near-zero hit rates on numerous other traces.
- **Feedback**: The rigid 80% protected limit provides scan resistance but likely starves the probationary segment during high churn, suggesting an adaptive partition size would improve consistency across diverse workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 3 - Patch Name slru_algorithm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: LeCaR with Randomized Policy Selection**
- **Implementation**: Maintains a probability weight to dynamically switch between LRU and LFU eviction, updating the weight via multiplicative updates when re-accessing previously evicted keys tracked in history buffers.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieves a low overall score of 0.21, with hit rates varying drastically from near 0% on many traces to 87% on specific stable workloads.
- **Feedback**: The probabilistic switching mechanism combined with a fixed learning rate appears too unstable for dynamic workloads, often failing to converge on an optimal policy quickly enough.

- **Implementation**: Maintains a small nursery queue (10%) and a main queue (90%) with a ghost cache to rescue frequently evicted items, using a 1-bit clock scheme for promotion and reinsertion.
- **Performance**: Combined score of 0.23, showing strong results on high-locality workloads (up to 88% hit rate) but near-zero performance on several specific traces.
- **Feedback**: The use of ghost caches and the S/M split provides effective scan resistance and frequency tracking, though the static 10% nursery size may lack flexibility for varying working set structures.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 8 - Patch Name s3fifo - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Segmented LRU with Fixed 80% Protected Capacity**
- **Implementation**: Utilizes an ordered dictionary for global LRU tracking and a set to maintain a protected segment (fixed at 80% of cache) where items are promoted upon hits and the segment's LRU is demoted when full.
- **Performance**: Achieves a combined score of 0.23, performing well on stable frequency traces (up to 0.88 hit rate) but poorly on high-churn or scan-heavy workloads.
- **Feedback**: The static partitioning effectively isolates the working set for specific traces but lacks the adaptability required to handle diverse access patterns found in the broader dataset.

- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.24, demonstrating strong adaptability on mixed workloads (up to 0.89 hit rate) while struggling with specific high-churn traces.
- **Feedback**: The implementation correctly captures the self-tuning nature of ARC to maximize hit rates, though the extensive state management and adaptation lag result in poor performance on datasets with rapidly shifting or massive working sets.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 11 - Patch Name implement_arc_algorithm - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: ARC with S3-FIFO Nursery Hybrid**
- **Implementation**: This algorithm places a small FIFO nursery queue in front of an Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), promoting accessed nursery items to ARC's recency list while using ghost lists to dynamically tune the balance between recency and frequency segments.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.23, showing high variability with excellent hit rates on specific traces (e.g., 0.88) but near-zero performance on several others.
- **Feedback**: While the nursery effectively filters one-hit wonders, its integration likely disrupts ARC's ghost list learning mechanism for certain access patterns, preventing the algorithm from correctly adapting `p` and leading to instability across diverse workloads.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 12 - Patch Name s3_fifo_arc_hybrid - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: S3-FIFO-D with Ghost Queue and Partitioned FIFO**
- **Implementation**: Implements a segmented FIFO strategy with a small probation queue (10% capacity) and a main queue, using a ghost cache to rescue evicted items and a second-chance mechanism for recurring hits in the main segment.
- **Performance**: The algorithm achieved a combined score of 0.25, excelling on stable workloads (e.g., trace 28 with 0.89) but performing poorly on scan-heavy traces (e.g., trace 14 with 0.00).
- **Feedback**: The fixed 10% probation size appears too rigid for workloads with high churn, suggesting that adaptive queue sizing or a more robust frequency filter is needed to handle diverse access patterns effectively.

**Program Name: LIRS Cache Eviction with Static HIR Buffer**
- **Implementation**: Implements the Low Inter-reference Recency Set (LIRS) algorithm using `OrderedDicts` for the history stack and resident queue, with a fixed 5% capacity reservation for HIR blocks.
- **Performance**: Achieves a composite score of 0.22, showing high effectiveness on stable, looping patterns (up to 88% hit rate) but near-zero performance on volatile traces.
- **Feedback**: While the LIRS logic effectively isolates the working set from scans, the static configuration and rigid promotion rules struggle to adapt to traces with rapidly shifting locality or random access patterns.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 14 - Patch Name lirs_optimized - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Static W-TinyLFU with Segmented LRU**
- **Implementation**: Implements a W-TinyLFU architecture with a fixed 5% admission window and a Segmented LRU main cache, using frequency-based duels to decide whether to admit new items or retain existing ones.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25, demonstrating strong performance on frequency-biased workloads but failing significantly on scan-heavy traces.
- **Feedback**: The static window size limits the algorithm's ability to adapt to changing workload patterns; implementing dynamic window sizing (as in Adaptive W-TinyLFU) could improve robustness across diverse traces.
**Program Identifier:** Generation 15 - Patch Name w_tinylfu_slru - Correct Program: True

**Program Name: Randomized Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC)**
- **Implementation**: Maintains ARC's dual lists (recency/frequency) and adaptive parameter `p` using ghost entries, but utilizes random eviction within the selected list instead of LRU.
- **Performance**: Achieved a combined score of 0.25 with highly variable hit rates, excelling on some workloads (0.89) but failing completely on others (0.00).
- **Feedback**: Replacing LRU with random eviction undermines ARC's recency tracking, significantly reducing effectiveness on standard locality traces despite the correctly implemented adaptive balancing logic.

# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

Based on the analysis of the individual program summaries and the code of the current best program, here are the actionable optimization insights.

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- **Static 1% Admission Window**: The top-performing programs (Generation 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69) converged on a fixed 1% admission window. Evaluations explicitly show that increasing this window to 5% (Generation 63, 68) consistently caused the score to drop from 0.27 to 0.26. This indicates that for this dataset, maximizing the Main cache capacity (specifically the Protected segment) is more critical than buffering larger scans.
- **Two-Hit Probation Promotion**: The current best program implements a strict SLRU promotion logic where items in the Probation segment are **not** promoted to Protected on the first hit. Instead, they are tracked in a `probation_hits` structure and only promoted on a subsequent access. This acts as a secondary filter (after the Doorkeeper) to strictly reserve the Protected segment for items with proven high frequency.
- **Main-Biased Tie-Breaking**: The eviction duel in the best code (`if freq_window > freq_main`) determines that if frequencies are equal, the Window item is evicted. This standard incumbency bias—retaining the Main item during ties—provides sufficient stability to maintain high hit rates on static traces (like Trace 28) without the need for the overly aggressive `+1` margin that hurt Generation 63.

## Ineffective Approaches
- **Enlarged Admission Windows (5%)**: Programs that attempted to increase the window size to 5% (Generation 63, 68) failed to outperform the 1% baseline. The feedback suggests that the larger window diluted the cache's ability to retain long-term hot items, leading to a net loss in performance despite theoretically better scan handling.
- **Overly Conservative Aging**: Generation 61 employed a "conservative aging" strategy which led to cache pollution by obsolete high-frequency items. While the best program uses periodic aging (every 5x capacity), making it too slow prevents the cache from clearing out old heavy hitters when the workload shifts, hurting performance on dynamic traces.
- **Runtime-Unsafe State Management**: Generation 60 failed completely because it attempted to access `capacity` in the `update_after_evict` function where it wasn't in scope. This highlights that all algorithmic parameters must be encapsulated within the persistent state object to ensure they are accessible across all lifecycle hooks.

## Implementation Insights
- **Graceful Protected Demotion**: The best program handles overflow in the Protected segment by **demoting** the victim back to the Probation segment rather than evicting it entirely. This keeps the item in the cache and gives it a "second chance" to prove its utility in the Probation queue, preventing the immediate loss of valuable but slightly colder items.
- **Clean Doorkeeper Transitions**: The implementation uses a standard Python `set` for the Doorkeeper. Crucially, when a key moves from the Doorkeeper to the Frequency map, the code explicitly performs `self.doorkeeper.remove(key)`. This ensures the Doorkeeper strictly filters only the very first access and keeps the memory footprint efficient.
- **Forced Window Availability**: The `evict` function in the best code explicitly checks `if len(state.window) >= state.window_size`. If the window is full, it forces a duel or eviction. This guarantees that the window never exceeds its tiny quota, preventing it from eating into the Main cache's capacity which is vital for the SLRU strategy.

## Performance Analysis
- **The 0.27 Score Ceiling**: Multiple distinct implementations (Gen 62, 64-67, 69) have hit a hard ceiling at a score of 0.27. These programs are characterized by excellent performance on static, repetitive traces (e.g., Trace 28 hit rate ~0.89) but near-zero performance on loop/scan traces (Trace 14 = 0.00).
- **Scan vs. Locality Trade-off**: The evaluations reveal a strict trade-off. Attempts to capture the scanning patterns of Trace 14 (via larger windows or looser admission) inevitably reduce the hit rate on Trace 28. Since Trace 28 offers a higher potential hit rate ceiling, the optimizer favors "specializing" in locality over scans.
- **Triple Filtering Efficacy**: The success of the current best architecture relies on a pipeline of three filters: 1) Doorkeeper (filters first access), 2) Admission Duel (filters entry to Main), and 3) Probation Promotion (filters entry to Protected). This aggressive multi-stage filtering is what allows a 99% Main cache to maintain high purity and achieve the 0.27 score.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

Based on the global insights and the analysis of the current best program (Generation 69), here are 5 actionable recommendations for future mutations:

1.  **Grant "Second Chance" Status on Demotion**
    Modify the `update_after_hit` logic to set `state.probation_hits[victim] = True` immediately when an item is demoted from the `protected` segment to `probation`. This acknowledges the item's previous high status and allows it to return to the protected segment with a single subsequent hit, reducing churn for the working set boundary compared to treating it as a raw newcomer.

2.  **Decouple Doorkeeper Reset from Frequency Aging**
    Change the `doorkeeper` clearing mechanism to trigger based on a size threshold (e.g., when `len(state.doorkeeper) > 2 * capacity`) rather than clearing it inside the periodic `age()` function. This prevents the filter from suffering "amnesia" on recently seen scan items just because the frequency aging timer fired, thereby improving scan resistance.

3.  **Lower Frequency Saturation Cap**
    Reduce `self.max_freq` from 60 to **15**. The current cap of 60 retains history for too long, causing the cache to hold onto "ghost" heavy hitters that are no longer relevant; a lower cap ensures the frequency sketch adapts faster to phase changes while still effectively distinguishing between one-hit wonders and established items.

4.  **Implement Segment-Aware Eviction Duel**
    Refine the `evict` function to use different tie-breaking logic based on the victim's segment. Use `freq_window >= freq_main` (ties evict Main/Probation) if the victim is in the **Probation** segment, but strictly `freq_window > freq_main` (ties keep Main/Protected) if the victim is in the **Protected** segment. This encourages faster turnover in the probation buffer while strictly stabilizing the core protected segment.

5.  **Frequency-Accelerated Promotion**
    Update `update_after_hit` to allow immediate promotion from `probation` to `protected` if `state.get_freq(key)` exceeds a "hot" threshold (e.g., 5), even if `probation_hits` is not satisfied. This utilizes the persistent frequency sketch to fast-track historically heavy hitters that have re-entered the cache, bypassing the standard two-hit probation requirement.
